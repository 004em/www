## Write the Docs website

This is the code that powers www.writethedocs.org. It will contain information
about Write the Docs as a group, as well as information about writing
documentation.

The repo is still in it's early stages, but feel free to contribute information
that you might want to share with the community.

#### How to use

This website uses ``mkdocs``, which is a Markdown site generator: http://www.mkdocs.org/

It is hosted on Read the Docs: https://readthedocs.org/projects/writethedocs-www/

We do development in a dev branch, which is rendered here: http://writethedocs-www.readthedocs.org/en/dev/

And production lives here: http://www.writethedocs.org/
