## Write the Docs website

This is the code that powers [www.writethedocs.org](http://www.writethedocs.org). It contains information
about the Write the Docs group, as well as information about writing documentation.

The repo is still in its early stages; feel free to contribute information that you might want to share with the community. 
To contribute to the Write the Docs website, familiarize yourself with the [Sphinx](sphinx-doc.org). 
The Write the Docs website is hosted on [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/writethedocs-www).

We develop documentation on a `dev` branch, which is rendered at http://writethedocs-www.readthedocs.org/en/dev/.
