  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Write the Docs is more than a conference. Each year we organize a wide bunch of events so that people can meet, collaborate, and learn from each other.</p>
  <p>This year, we have events planned all day on Sunday, the day before the conference, and our annual hike will take place on Saturday afternoon. Our Sunday events include our Writing Day documentation sprints during the day, and our conference reception in the evening.</p>
