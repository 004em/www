Slack
=====

Our Slack network has a bunch of interesting folks hanging out and chatting about documentation.
It's the best way to connect with our community,
and to stay in touch with folks you've met at our conferences and meetups.

Below we have a bit more information about the useful Slack channels that we have.
This should start you off on the right foot,
and get you connected with folks who have similar interests.

You can `join our Slack <http://slack.writethedocs.org/>`_ if you aren't already a member.
