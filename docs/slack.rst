Write the Docs Slack
====================

Our Slack network has a bunch of interesting folks hanging out and chatting about documentation.
It's the best way to connect with our community,
and to stay in touch with folks you've met at our conferences and meetups.

Below we have a bit more information about the useful Slack channels that we have.
This should start you off on the right foot,
and get you connected with folks who have similar interests.

You can `join our Slack <http://slack.writethedocs.org/>`_ if you aren't already a member.

Default channels

* #general - The main channel for random conversation
* #jobs - Posting or asking for jobs
* #conferences - Questions and other thoughts around the :doc:`/conf`
* #meetups - Questions and other thoughts about our :doc:`/meetups/index`
* #watercooler - For anything that you randomly want to talk about. Feel free to express yourself :)

Other useful topical channels

Lots of location-based channels
-------------------------------

We have too many location-based channels to list.
Chances are we have a large group of folks in your neck of the woods,
so join up and chat with them.
They're a great way to get in touch with your local meetup organizer and community.
