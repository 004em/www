Documentarians
==============

When we :doc:`created </origin-story>` Write the Docs,
we felt there was a missing term for someone who cares about documentation.
It shouldn't be a job title,
but an independent identity.
We started using the word *documentarian* to describe this type of person:

**A documentarian is someone who cares about the value of documentation and communication in the software industry, regardless of job title.**

Expanding the meaning of documentarian to include folks of any job title is important.
Historically you could be a "tech writer" or a "programmer",
but there wasn't a way to think about being someone who cares about communication and documentation.
We hope to change this.

Join us:

* If you're a programmer that loves writing docs, you're a documentarian
* If you're a tech writer that cherishes using the right word to convey an idea, you're a documentarian
* If you're a sales person who thinks that documentation is a fundamental part of the sales process for your product, you're a documentarian
* If you're a support person who loves that documentation helps your users, you're a documentarian
* If you are a user of software and rejoice when there are instructions that help you, you're a documentarian
  
We hope that you'll join us in embracing this identity within our industry.
Being able to take pride in documentation & communication as part of your identity is a way to make sure we build a more empathetic and welcoming community.
