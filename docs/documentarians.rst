Documentarians
==============

When we :doc:`created </origin-story>` Write the Docs,
we felt there was a missing term for someone who cares about documentation.
It shouldn't be a job title,
but an independent identity.
We started using the word *documentarian* to describe this type of person;
someone who cares about the value of documentation and communication in the tech industry.

Expanding the meaning of documentarian to include folks of any job title is important.
Historically you could be a "tech writer" or a "programmer",
but there wasn't a way to think about being someone who cares about communication and documentation.

* If you're a programmer that loves writing docs, you're a documentarian
* If you're a tech writer that cherishs using the right word to convey an idea, you're a documentarian
* If you're a sales who thinks that documentation is a fundamental part of the sales process for your product, you're a documentarian
* If you are a user of software and rejoice when there are instructions that help you, you're a documentarian
  
We hope that you'll join us in embracing this identity within our industry.
Being able to take pride in documentation & communication as part of your identity is a way to make sure we build a more empathetic and welcoming community.
