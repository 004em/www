Mailing List
~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have mailing lists for our Monthly Newsletter, North American Conferences, and European Conferences.
They are low traffic, and only send occasional community and event updates.

You can sign up in our sidebar.

Slack
~~~~~

You can join us on the :doc:`/slack` for real-time discussion and to keep in touch with folks from the community.

Slack conversations aren't archived, so we recommend either putting substantial items of interest on the forum,
or moving them there if they develop into something bigger.

Learn more about our :doc:`/slack`.

Twitter
~~~~~~~

We're pretty active on `Twitter <https://twitter.com/hashtag/writethedocs?f=tweets&vertical=default&lang=en>`__ as well, mostly on **#writethedocs**.

Forum
~~~~~

Check out our `Forum <http://forum.writethedocs.org/>`__ to keep in
touch with your fellow documentarians.

The forum is the place to start discussions that we should keep around for a while. If a Slack conversation
starts to get a lot of attention and seems like something of permanent interest, we suggest that you move it
over to the forum.

Blog
~~~~~

Check out our :doc:`/blog/index` to see updates from the Community. These will also be sent to the :doc:`/newsletter`.

Write to Us
