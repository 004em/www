Mailing List
~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have mailing lists for our Monthly Newsletter, North American Conferences, and European Conferences.
They are low traffic, and only send occasional community and event updates.

You can sign up in our sidebar.

Slack
~~~~~

You can join us on the :doc:`/slack` for real-time discussion and to keep in touch with folks from the community.

Slack conversations aren't archived, so we recommend either putting substantial items of interest on the forum,
or moving them there if they develop into something bigger.

Learn more about our :doc:`/slack`.

Twitter
~~~~~~~

We're pretty active on `Twitter <https://twitter.com/hashtag/writethedocs?f=tweets&vertical=default&lang=en>`__ as well, mostly on **#writethedocs**.

Blog
~~~~~

Check out our :doc:`/blog/index` to see updates from the Community. These will also be sent to the :doc:`/newsletter`.

Write to Us
