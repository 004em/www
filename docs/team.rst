Write the Docs is a community effort that is enabled by a wonderful team of folks.
We are always looking for more people to help organize events,
meetups,
or just take a leadership role in the community.
This page documents the status of different members of the community,
and also explains some of the roles that people are filling.

These roles help folks join and contribute to the Write the Docs community. 
Some of them are already filled,
but if you're interested in helping out with any of them,
just drop us a line at conf@writethedocs.org,
or send one of us a DM on Slack.
