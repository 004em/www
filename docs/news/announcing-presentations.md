# Announcing Presentations and Speakers

Our talk selection process has just wrapped up and we're eager to
announce the presentations for this year's conference. We try to
highlight the intersection of tech writers and developers with our
presentations, because we feel we all have a lot to learn from each
other.

Within the next couple weeks, we'll be announcing the details for the
conference events: the annual hike on Saturday, the documentation hack
day and the preregistration party on Sunday, and the official party on
Monday evening. You'll be able to sign up for tickets for those events
once everything is announced.

If you haven't purchased your ticket yet, you still have some time. [You can
pick up your tickets here][tickets].
