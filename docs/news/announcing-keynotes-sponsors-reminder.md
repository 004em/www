## Announcing Keynotes, Initial Sponsors, and a Reminder

The conference is three months away, 
so I hope you're getting ready!

The Early Bird tickets have sold out,
thanks for everyone who has already purchased a ticket.
We do expect the conference to sell out fully,
so [buy your tickets](https://ti.to/writethedocs/write-the-docs-na-2015/) today.

#### Keynote Speakers

In previous years, we haven't had keynotes.
As the community and conference has developed,
we have noticed two main themes.
We have Programmers who care about docs,
and Writers who care about tech.
We collectively call these folks *documentarians*.

This years keynotes each come from one of these camps;
Programmer and Writer.

Our first keynote speaker is [Ward Cunningham](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham).
Ward is the creator of the wiki,
and has one of the longest views on how the web is used of anyone in the world.
He will be speaking about his view of content on the web,
and how it's shaping his latest project,
the Federated Wiki.

Our scond keynote speaker is [Marcia Johnston](http://howtowriteeverything.com/marcia-riefer-johnston-bio/).
Marcia is the author of multiple books on writing well,
and speaks on the topic at conferences around the country.
She will be speaking about how to make sure the words you write actually get understood by your readers.
A member of our community since the first conference,
she will help us all become better writers once again.

More information about these talks can be found on the [TODO:website](TODO).

The Call for Proposals ends on **February 28th at Midnight PST**,
