Welcome to the Write the Docs Community
=======================================

**Write the Docs** is a global community of people who care about documentation. We have:
* A :doc:`slack network </slack>`
* :doc:`conferences </conf/index>` on 3 continents
* :doc:`local meetups </meetups/index>`
* :doc:`a whole lot more </about/index>`!

We consider everyone who cares about communication, documentation, and
their users to be a member of our community. This can be programmers,
tech writers, developer advocates, customer support, marketers, and anyone else who wants
people to have great experiences with software.

Our conferences create a time and a place for the global community of
:doc:`documentarians` to share information, discuss ideas, and work together
to improve the **art and science of documentation**.
