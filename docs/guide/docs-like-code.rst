Docs like Code
============

:author: `Eric Holscher <https://ericholscher.com>`_

*Docs like Code* refers to a philosophy that you should be writing documentation with the same tools you use to write code.
This means following the same workflows and integrating into development teams.
It enables a culture where writers and developers both feel ownership of documentation,
and work together to make it as good as possible.

Generally a *docs like Code* approach gives you the following benefits:

* Writers integrate better with development teams
* Developers will often write a first draft of documentation
* You can block merging of new features if they don't include documentation, which incentivizes developers to 

There is a lot more to building a proper *Docs like Code* workflow.
There are a couple books we recommend that you check out:

* Docs like Code - Anne Gentle
* Modern Technical Writing - Andrew Etter
    
*Docs like Code* at Write the Docs
----------------------------------

Write the Docs has had a number of talks that touch on this topic over the years.

**2015 North America**

* `Riona MacNamara`_ talked about how adopting *Docs like Code* has completely transformed how Google does documentation.

**2016 North America**

* We had a `panel`_ with folks from Rackspace, Microsoft, Balsamiq, and Twitter, all talking about how they are adopting these practices.

**2016 Europe**

* `Margaret Eker and Jennifer Roundeau`_ from Rackspace & Capital One, it was a great overview of *Docs as Code*.
* `Rachel Whitten`_ from Pantheon give a talk on their implementation of these approaches.

The *Docs like Code* concepts are widely practiced in the software industry,
and are gaining adoption in the writing community.
