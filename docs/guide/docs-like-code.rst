Docs like Code
============

*Docs like Code* refers to a philosophy that you should be writing documentation with the same tools you use to write code.
This means following the same workflows and integrating into development teams.

Generally a *Docs like Code* approach gives you the following benefits:

* Writers integrate better with development teams
* Developers will write a first draft of documentation
* You can block merging of new features if they don't include documentation

Write the Docs has had a number of talks that touch on this topic over the years.
In Portland 2015,
`Riona MacNamara`_ talked about how adopting *Docs like Code* has completely transformed how Google does documentation.
At our 2016 US conference,
we had a `panel`_ with folks from Rackspace,
Microsoft,
Balsamiq,
and Twitter,
all talking about how they are adopting these practices.
Our 2016 EU conference had talks from `Margaret Eker and Jennifer Roundeau`_ and `Rachel Whitten`_ give talks as well.

The *Docs like Code* concepts are widely practiced in the software industry,
and are gaining adoption in the writing community.
