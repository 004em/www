## What's a Documentarian?

Write the Docs has added another usage of the word "documentarian".
We are slightly extending the classic definition of:

	A writer, photographer, or other artist whose work constitutes a document or documentary of an aspect of life.

We believe that a Documentarian is also someone working in technology who cares about documentation.
In general,
a documentarian has the following qualities:

  * A documentarian is someone who wants to share something with someone, looks at a blank screen, and [knows what should be there](http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/m/michelange161309.html).

  * A documentarian uses the tools of code, technical writing, and visual design to create engaging [learning](http://www.makinglearningvisibleresources.org/documentation-when-does-it-make-learning-visible.html) experiences that work well for a wide variety of people.

  * A documentarian is more than an intersection of skills; it's someone with [empathy](http://alexwarren.co.uk/2013/06/26/documentation-empathy/) for the learner, and a unique vision for the accessibility of difficult topics.

  * A documentarian does more than describing what's there; they explain how to use it in a way that you can understand it.

We hope you will proudly identify as a *documentarian* after attending Write the Docs.
You might just already be one,
and not know it yet :)
