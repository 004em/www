I'll go over the tools we chose to write, build, and test the docs; the responsibilities of the software engineers and technical writer, respectively, for creating and maintaining content; the docs information architecture we developed; how we incorporated syntax and grammar checks into code testing; and how we build and deploy our documentation automatically.</p>",

At Red Hat, everything. </p>\n<p>You see, when we wanted to make a culture shift in our approach to documentation, we couldn\u2019t legislate the change from the top down. Managers and experts just don\u2019t have that kind of authority at Red Hat. Changing the way we write has had to be a grassroots, bottom-up effort. Just like we all get to vote on which flavors of sparkling water and other beverages are stocked in our fridge, writers, editors, content strategists, and managers ALL have a say in our latest writing trends. At Red Hat, we have an open culture where people expect to have a voice in decisions and aren\u2019t afraid to speak their minds. This open culture affects every aspect of our working lives.</p>\n<p>What Did We Want to Change?\nWe wanted to introduce our teams to minimalist writing. But first we had to convince people that minimalism isn\u2019t just about shorter sentences and less fluffy documentation. Minimalist writing means that you focus like a laser on just what your customers need at the moment. It\u2019s harder than it sounds. </p>\n<p>How Did We Do It?\nFirst, we formed an international team that could influence writers across all our geographical regions (geos). Brice Fallon-Freeman (from Australia), Aneta Petrov\u00e1 (from the Czech Republic), and I (from the US) became this team and brainstormed ways to introduce these concepts to our departments. </p>\n<p>Aneta and Brice came up with the idea of crowdsourcing minimalist writing critiques, and all three of us tried the concept in our different geos. We got volunteers to join our groups, and then we got more volunteers who were willing to have their content critiqued. This \u201ccrowd\u201d of writers and editors then worked together to give meaningful feedback to the people who had been brave enough to volunteer their content. </p>\n<p>The beauty of this model is that it gives experienced writers a way to teach more junior writers without the process being apparent. No one has to admit to being ignorant. Inexperienced writers get to learn about minimalism by watching other people apply it to real content and not in some kind of fake training situation. </p>\n<p>This talk will discuss our strategies and methods in more detail and show examples of content before and after crowdsourced minimalism.</p>",

        "abstract": "<p>Last spring, as I approached reworking the information architecture of the NPR One Developer Center, I started by interviewing several of our partner developers to find out what pain points they encountered when developing on our platform.</p><p>Overwhelmingly, the responses included complaints about confusing site navigation and frustration around having to search multiple pages to string together the necessary information to implement features. After considering this feedback, we redesigned the documentation site to focus on information needed to complete a desired task, and while we still provide endpoint reference documentation, my focus now is to start from thinking about what a developer is trying to accomplish, rather than what data an endpoint is capable of providing. Essentially, the focus of the docs shifted away from what the API can do, towards what “I”, as the developer, can do with this API.</p><p>Taking a task-oriented approach allowed us to reorganize and revise our content in a way that has significantly shortened our onboarding process for partner developers, shortening the app verification process and time-to-market, and most importantly allows us to better collaborate with our partners to develop exciting new experiences for NPR listeners. For those who work on documenting hypermedia APIs, this can be a particularly useful approach, since these services tend to have fewer specific endpoints, and the documentation needs to focus much more on how the client can successfully navigate links to accomplish the desired task. In this 30-minute talk, I’ll discuss how you can successfully integrate this approach to your work􀂡ow when considering everything from overall information architecture, to deciding which content assets to prioritize, to refining the tone used throughout your developer communications.</p>",

Tutorials can show how, real-world configuration examples show what, and cookbooks provide ready-made examples to customize as needed. Deployment checklists ensure the rollout goes smoothly.</p><p> Emergencies can happen at any hour—which is why runbooks can be so valuable.
