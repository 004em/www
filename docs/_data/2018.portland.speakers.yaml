 abstract: "<p>API documentation can been grouped into four classes\u2014Overviews,\

  title: 'Audience, Market, Product: Tips for strategic API documentation planning'
  year: 2018
- abstract: '<p>In this talk, I''ll provide eight essential tips that will help you
    become a more effective tech writer. These are core principles that have guided
    me during almost two decades in the business. Here they are, distilled down into
    a half hour of concentrated fun:</p>

    <ol>

    <li>Just ask. The idea for this talk started during the WTD hike in 2016, when
    Jacob Moses started asking about my work. Later he asked me to be a guest on his
    podcast to discuss how to future proof yourself as a tech writer.  The idea of
    being bold and just asking people, as Jacob did, is one of the most important
    things you can do.  I''ll share a few of my favorite questions.</li>

    <li>Then, listen with an open heart and mind. Give your full attention. It''s
    hard but it gets easier the more you practice.</li>

    <li>Tell stories.  This applies to everything you do.  Even your automatic email
    reply.  Pay attention to how you start. Newspaper articles frequently start with
    an anecdote. When you tell a story, adjust how you begin for the audience, providing
    a high level clue-in as needed.  Storytelling is one of the most important skills
    you can learn. I''ll include resources at the end.</li>

    <li>Own your stuff. One of my former colleagues always had an excuse why he couldn''t
    do something because someone else hadn''t come through. As tech writers, sometimes
    we feel like we are at the end of the chain. A key realization is that you own
    your docs like a developer owns their code. You make the final decisions.  A writer
    asking "should the docs say x or y" is like a reporter asking "should the story
    say x or y" Instead, ask for input, own the output.</li>

    <li>Find go-to people. There is a doc-friendly person in every group. If they''re
    willing, have them review your doc first.</li>

    <li>Minimum viable is your friend.  Use the "just send me something" gambit, with
    the caveat that it doesn''t have to be perfect. When emailing on a tech review,
    instead of asking questions about the doc, put the actual text in the mail and
    iterate on that.   Include your default course of action in the event of no reply.
    </li>

    <li>Always keep learning. Have a preferred super tool for automating stuff.  Learn
    by incremental doing.</li>

    <li>Say yes. Seize the moment when your manager says who wants to do the new task.  Cultivate
    an up for anything mindset.  Help others learn and succeed.</li>

    </ol>

    <p>A tiny but mighty bonus tip: Give praise.  Highest benefit to cost ratio you''ll
    ever see.</p>'

- abstract: "<p>Thorough and optimal technical documentation often requires not just\
    \ an API reference of endpoints and parameters, or long contextual instructions,\
    \ but also code examples that users can cut and paste into their applications.\
    \ As a technical writer at Stripe, I\u2019m partially responsible for maintaining\
    \ 150 code examples, each of which needs to be in 8 programming languages. In\
    \ this presentation, I\u2019ll explain the processes we\u2019re using, the hurdles\
    \ we\u2019re facing, and the solutions we\u2019ve devised thus far to make and\
    \ maintain code examples that really shine.</p>\n<p>Specific concepts covered\
    \ include:\n- Defining a style guide for your code\n- Generating code examples\
    \ programmatically \n- Testing examples to ensure they work\n- Using common snippets\
    \ to save time\n- Enhancing examples for a better user experience</p>\n<p>Although\
    \ we haven\u2019t solved all our problems in this area, we\u2019ve made great\
    \ progress with great results, and I look forward to sharing our best policies\

    \ humans to create, publish and present technical content in a variety of media.\
    \ Primarily blog content. Mostly text. Not documentation. Sometimes it\u2019s\
    \ a mighty fine line, but I think we can and should differentiate.</p>\n<p>I manage\
    \ the editorial workflow of Mozilla Hacks, a blog with tens of thousands of weekly\
    \ readers, that aims for a cadence of 1-3 posts per week and aspires to grow the\
    \ reach and influence of Mozilla and Firefox. We cover web development for an\
    \ audience of designers, developers and people who make websites. Our focus is\
    \ pragmatic. Sometimes our goal is to announce, inform, explain - here are some\
    \ of our fave new features, here\u2019s how to use them in your work, here's why\
    \ you should care. Sometimes we really want the reader to take a specific action,\
    \ or try something and share feedback.</p>\n<p>This talk will explore the principles\
    \ of kind, effective editorial practice, and the nuances and attributes of voice,\
    \ civility, and clear communication, as they play out when working with a diverse\
    \ distributed base of writers, many of whom are non-native English speakers and\
    \ inexperienced writers or storytellers. </p>\n<p>I believe there's as much need\
    \ for diversity of voice and point of view in blogging about software development\
    \ as there is in speaking about it at developer conferences. And I've got some\
    \ observations to share about how we can cultivate many voices to amplify the\
    \ value and effectiveness of all our technical communications. </p>"

- abstract: <p>There are multiple reasons to use screenshots, from introducing new
    features and helping confirm the context of content to simply breaking up walls
    of text. However, screenshots can carry a lot of overhead, including localization
    considerations and short shelf-lives due to continuous deployment, which may make
    them more effort than their worth. For content that appears in context of the
    UI, screenshots can also be redundant and unnecessary. As alternatives to screenshots,
    there are several visual content strategies to consider to engage audiences and
    convey and complement concepts and UIisms, including infographics, illustrations,
    and abstract "simplified UI (SUI)" representations. Which you use depends on your
    intent and message.</p>

  title: 'Graphic Content Warning: The Pros, Cons, and Alternatives to Screenshots'
  year: 2018
- abstract: '<p>Years of being one of the "technical people" in activist circles resulted
    in my being continually called on to help community groups and fellow organizers
    understand and more correctly wield technology in service of their mission. Using
    my blogpost "Three Tips for Providing Tech Help to Non-Profits and Other Such
    Organizations" as a point of departure, I will share my experience and derived
    best practices.  </p>

    <p>From "basics", like how to use documents and spreadsheets, to working with
    databases and understanding security, I have given assistance to a great many
    groups and the most important part is always the documentation that I leave behind.
    I can rarely ever just point people to the official software or open source project
    documentation, I almost always have to rewrite the docs for them in simple language
    that references their specific use case. </p>

    <p>I wish to help community and activist groups make better technical choices
    so that they feel more in control of the technologies they use. My hope is that
    in sharing my experiences, I can engage in a deeper dialogue with the technical
    documentation community about how we can make technical documentation more accessible,
    easier to re-use, and empowering.</p>'
