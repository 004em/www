-   abstract: '<p>Open source projects are generally started by talented coders.
        Generally, though, their skills don't stretch to writing good documentation.
        Users depend on good documentation, from the project's README to the Getting Started Guide, through to API documentation.
        A small portion of those users may become contributors, and they need more advanced documentation and guidance.
        Without good documentation, even the greatest project will struggle.</p>

        <p>Technical writers can play a key role in the success of open source projects. It's good for the projects, but it's also good for the writers themselves.</p>
        <p>Benefits to writers include:</p>
        <li><p>Getting exposure to techniques and technology they may not do in their day jobs.</li></p>
        <li><p>Those looking to break into technical writing can get a start, and build up a public portfolio.</li></p>
        <li><p>Being part of a global community provides public exposure not otherwise possible.</li></p>
        <li><p>HAn opportunity to be part of a team.</li></p>

-   abstract: <p>Developers of voice and chat assistants are crying out for good writers to help them create the conversational interfaces of the present and future. In this talk, I will introduce what constitutes a 'good' conversational experience and how we, as writers, can benefit from this trend.
    This will include advice on tone, variety of language, setting and checking user context, testing interfaces, presenting choice and much more.</p>

-   abstract: "<p>Figuring out what to write and how to write it can be tricky. In this talk, I lead you through the process that I use in order to figure out what needs writing, in what order, to provide my audience with the best experience and value, no matter the subject area.
    The talk covers practical aspects of reviewing briefs and specifications, audience and competitor research, and determining and prioritising value when you structure and write your documentation..</p>"

-   abstract: "<p>Sphinx is an open source documentation platform. It provides an easy way to generate documentation to multiple formats (html, manpage, text, pdf, ...) out of a single set of reStructuredText sources. It has great inbuilt support for documenting software projects, but can be used for anything.
    One of its strengths is its capacity for custom extensions, allowing you to add functionality to meet the particular needs of your project.
    Come for a tutorial of the extensions mechanism in Sphinx. Learn how to generate a Google sitemap dynamically; and how to embed a "last updated" timestamp in your documentation, based on the time it was modified in version control.
    Basic familiarity with programming is helpful, but you do not need to be a programming wizard to understand this talk.</p>"

-   abstract: "<p>Well-written documentation is what we should all be striving for. Recently, Red Hat has focused specifically on quality. I took the job of constructing a team to learn about minimalism and how it can help us in technical communication.
    Throughout this, I found the key to understanding minimalism to be comic strips. Learning to properly document a procedure is similar to telling a story in four panels and the tenets of minimalism are similar to those of a Peanuts strip.
    These findings have helped create a standard that the technical writers at Red Hat can now easily follow, using learning modules, crowdsourced review seminars, and even stickers and posters</p>"
