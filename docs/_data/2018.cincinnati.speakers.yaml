- abstract: "<p>Structured writing has never been more important,
    or more confusing. We keep trying to do more and more with content
    and give ourselves less and less time to do it. Structured writing
    can help keep our rhetoric on track and our processes efficient.
    But how does it do that and what is the relationship between rhetoric
    and process?</p>\n

    <p>It is easy to get lost in sea of acronyms and buzzwords: semantics,
    XML, metadata, DITA, structure, DocBook, hypertext, Markdown, topics,
    XSLT, reuse, LaTeX, silos, HTML. This talk cuts through the noise,
    explaining what structured writing is (you have been doing it all
    along) and how different structures are used to achieve different
    purposes.</p>\n

    <p>Most canned structured writing systems are all about process and
    can actively get in the way of good rhetoric. Deliberately avoiding
    the discussion of any particular structured writing system, this talk
    focuses on showing how structured writing can be used to improve
    rhetoric and how a focus on rhetoric can enhance process as well.
    It shows how the right structured writing techniques can improve the
    quality of your content and make your content process more efficient
    at the same time, without having to sacrifice quality for efficiency
    or vice versa.</p>"

  title: Structured Writing: How Rhetoric Supports Process
  year: '2018'
- abstract: "<p>Who cares about content? Everyone who touches an open
    source project! The community can’t contribute to a project they
    don’t understand. But writing documentation isn’t enough: you need
    a content strategy that defines how the content will be structured,
    written, tested, and updated along the way as contributions come in.
    If there is no proper process in place, you are going to be in one
    hot mess.</p>\n

    <p>In this session, attendees will learn:</p>\n
    <ul>\n
      <li>What’s in store for open source technical documentation</li>\n
      <li>The people and technology needed to help you create open
        source documentation</li>\n
      <li>What matters most: quantity over quality or quality over
        quantity?</li>\n
      <li>What it takes to have open source documentation that drives
        customer satisfaction</li>\n
      <li>Making the process work for your organization with every
        contribution</li>\n
    </ul>\n"

- abstract: "<p>This talk will best practices on how create documentation
    that can be within reach to individuals who might not have ever thought
    they would be writing code before. This talk will be framed around why
    accessible documentation needs to be a part of the conversation around
    diversity and inclusion.</p>\n

    <p>We’ll get started by defining what accessible documentation looks like.
    We’ll also cover what common pitfalls exist and how to prevent falling
    into these traps such as talking in jargon and assuming a base of
    experience that isn’t defined.  We’ll also discuss about code examples
    in documentation and what context is needed to ensure that these are
    reachable to wide audience.. This talk will conclude with a checklist
    of what makes documentation accessible to wide audience.</p>\n"

  title: How to ensure your documentation is accessible for new programmers
  year: '2018'
- abstract: "<p>When we choose to manage docs like code, we gain a variety
    of options for where to store the “source” files of those docs, and how
    they interact with the code they document. The question then becomes, how
    do we choose among these options? Do we store docs in the code, near the
    code, or in a separate location altogether? What are the implications of
    these choices, for the docs themselves and for the people who maintain
    them?</p>\n

    <p>Open source projects provide a great source for guidance on these questions,
    because their docs, their code, and the evolution of the processes used to
    create both are open for public viewing. As a documentarian working on a
    number of open source projects, as well as providing site deployment support
    to even more, I’ve seen and tried a variety of strategies, and learned from
    both successes and failures.</p>\n

    <p>I’ll cover the benefits and challenges of different approaches, give
    examples of specific projects using each approach, and detail the docs
    evolution of a single open source project, Netlify CMS, as we moved
    through different strategies to meet changing needs and unexpected
    challenges. You’ll leave with guidelines for choosing the best “path”
    for your current and future docs-as-code projects, along with exemplars
    to consult for guidance when you make your choice.</p>"

  title: Finding a Home for Docs
  year: '2018'
- abstract: "<p>We have never written documentation for just one audience,
    and we have never been able to count on our product name staying the
    same. Back when we were in Kansas, we had powerful writing IDEs to
    manage these problems. But now that we're in Oz, docs are code and
    code is documentation, and it all seems very different. Follow along
    with me as we explore some use cases and lesser-used code tools to
    deliver our users exactly the documentation they need, no more and
    no less. That's a horse of a different color!</p>\n

    <p>This talk will briefly touch on toolchains and workflows that peaked
    when we were still delivering help with software, and extrapolate how
    we can use modern code practices and deployment styles to replicate
    the best parts. These will include universal variables, tying
    documentation delivery to the version of the product provided, and
    allowing users to select what they want help with.</p>"
