Write the Docs 2018 Kick-Off
============================

Greetings, global documentarians!

Mikey here, writing from the deep dark cold European winter, but looking forward to spring and summer, full of sunshine and docs!
Following Eric's winter-warming `2017 Stats <http://www.writethedocs.org/blog/write-the-docs-2017-stats/>`_ post, I'd like to highlight some of the activities, changes, and experiments that you can expect in 2018.

These efforts are a part of optimizing our work in supporting and growing the community, and the also aim to keep things fresh and exciting for our documentarians.

We hope that you'll enjoy the shiny new things and of course, if you'd like to contribute to any of these efforts or have experiments that you'd like to pursue, please write to us at support@writethedocs.org and let us know!

So, new year - new...

Core Team
---------

Since the original Write the Docs conference was held in 2012, the folks behind the scenes have contributed their time, efforts, and talent on a volunteer basis, with tremendous results.

Over the years, the community grew to a point where we needed to examine its long-term needs and develop a system that will support the community without burning out the people who are filling key global roles.

Last year we decided to try setting up a formalized a small, part-time paid staff with the goal of consolidating various roles and responsibilities that could be handled globally, such as web administration, swag coordination, staff wrangling, and meetup overseeing.

So far the experiment has been successful, and the core team now includes the following dedicated documentarians:

- Eric Holscher: Co-founder, head of North America conferences, global sponsorship coordinator
- Mikey Ariel: Head of Europe conferences, global swag coordinator, communication chair
- Samuel Wright: Head of support, Webmaster/GitHubmaster, meetup overseer, speaker coordinator (Europe)
- Kelly O'Brien: Head of newsletter, job board coordinator, speaker coordinator (North America)

These roles are on an including-but-not-limited-to basis, since there are lots of smaller, ad-hoc tasks that the core team runs into throughout the year.

If you want to learn more about the organization behind the community, you can read :doc:`About Us </about-us>`. You can also find a high-level overview of the teams and tasks in :doc:`Team </team>`.

Job Board
---------

As we mentioned in previous newsletters and Slack posts, we are launching a shiny new job board! Led by Kelly O'Brien, the job board aims to make it easy for documentarians to find their dream gigs, and for employers to find their dream documentarians.

We're currently in the beta-testing phase, so if you're interested in helping us test the board – either as an employer or an applicant – we'd love to hear from you at `jobs@writethedocs.org <mailto:jobs@writethedocs.org>`_.

Note: In order to help optimize our job-related efforts, we looked at our current communication channels, and came to the conclusion that the #jobs Slack channel together with the job board is the most likely to be a successful combination. Therefore, we are sadly closing the Write the Docs forum on (date?).

Swag
----

Some of you might have noticed that this year's conference tickets do not include shirts. We realized that after 5 years of printing shirts for multiple conferences, the swag offering could use a bit of a refresh. In addition, the overhead of printing hundreds of shirts and managing inventory simply proved ineffective over time.

So this year we are changing swag tactics, and instead of including shirts with the ticket purchase, we happily present **tote bags**! No sizing required, smoother production workflow, and just as collectible :)

But have no fear, you can still get a shirt for your favorite conference! Inspired by the likes of DjangoCon US, we will team up with `TeeSpring <http://teespring.com/>`_, a trusted print-on-demand provider that works on a campaign-based model.

Over the next few weeks we will be setting up a campaign where you can order a shirt with this year's conference design, and anyone who orders by a certain date should receive their shirt in time for the conference.

We will continue to print speaker and staff hoodies, since we can estimate sizing and quanitities much more accurately than we can with shirts.

Community-Run Events
--------------------

In addition to the official conferences that are organized by our team and carry the formal Write the Docs brand, we have seen a growing number of events that are organized by our community members.

We are thrilled that our community is excited to share knowledge and network with like-minded folks, and happy to support and cross-promote these events in our community.

To clarify the difference between a core Write the Docs event and a community-run event, and to answer questions for those who wish to start a community event, we created :doc:`Community-Run Events </organizer-guide/community-events>`.

Hopefully this information is helpful, but feel free to write to use at support@writethedocs.org if you have any questions.

Happy New Year
--------------

We're proud and thrilled to have such a lively growing community all over the world, and we hope that you'll continue to enjoy participating and contributing to the current and new activities.

Here's to an amazing 2018!
