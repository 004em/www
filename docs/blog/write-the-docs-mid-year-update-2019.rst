Write the Docs 2019 Community Update
====================================


Hey there documentarians.
The newsletter team is taking the month off,
but that doesn't mean the community is standing still.
We decided to send out a community update to let you know what's going on with the community. 

Salary Survey
--------------

The biggest thing that we're excited about is a new :doc:` Salary Survey </surveys/salary-survey-sep-2019>`.
Our goal is to help people understand the pay scales and benefits in the software industry around documentation.
This will help people get a better understanding of what an appropriate salary is,
and then negotiate for a better one.

The survey is 21 questions broken up into 4 parts.
Please fill it out here: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/wtd-salary-2019

The salary will be open until October 15th, 2019,
after that we will process the data and publish the results.

Community Interviews
---------------------

We have finished up the summer internship that we ran this year with `Mohit Patel`_.
We now have `13 interviews with people in the community`_ sharing their history in the industry,
as well as suggestions for folks who are just getting started.

We're excited to have this resource available for people who are hoping to get into the industry.
It's often hard to understand how to get started,
and having so many different stories and backgrounds really shows there isn't a "proper" path,
but many different ways.

Another US Conference
---------------------

We're also excited to start planning another US conference in 2020.
The goal will be to make closer to folks on the east coast,
but we haven't figured out exactly where to host it yet.

Currently we're in the process of trying to find suitable venues.
If you know of a good venue in your city,
please submit them in our `request for venues`_.

Speaking of remote events, on October 7th, Deborah Barnard and Lorna Jane from our North England meetup are running a virtual docs hackathon as part of `Hacktoberfest <https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/>`_, more info at https://www.starfallprojects.co.uk/blog/hacktoberfest-2019/

Also noteworthy is the neverending search for both a San Francisco lead meetup organizer and a Bay Area meetup coordinator. If you're in the area, and attend meetups regularly, maybe you'd like to find out a little more about what is involved? https://www.meetup.com/Write-the-Docs-Bay-Area/
