# Announcing Write the Docs 2015

We are excited to announce the Write the Docs Portland dates for 2015! We are back in the same city and venue, but we're expanding the reach of the conference. We've always had a bunch of optional activities on the Sunday before the event, and this year we're expandind them into a full third day of fun. It's still optional, but we recommend you come into town Saturday or early Sunday to participate.

* Write the Docs North America will be in **Portland, Oregon on May 17-19.**
* The auxilary events, including the pre-registration and sprints will happen on **May 17**
* The conference will happen **May 18-19**

The dates are again on a Monday and Tuesday. We will be announcing pricing information soon. 

### Events

Write the Docs is more than a conference. Each year we have a bunch of auxilary events so that people can get to know each other better. This year, those events will include:

* Hike (Saturday day) - Enjoy the magestic beauty of Portland with this walk in the woods.
* Writing Day (Sunday day) - Get together and actually *write the docs* with your fellow documentarians. Work on open source documentation (Wordpress, Mozilla Developer Network), and share tips and tricks.
* Pre-Registration (Sunday Night) - Come early and get your badge and get to know folks
* Official Party (Monday Night) - Wind down and talk about the days talks in a relaxed and friendly environment
