Moving our Portland and Prague 2020 conferences online
======================================================

Hey everyone,

We hope that you're holding up during these trying times.
We are all stuck at home,
but still thinking about docs :)

We're writing with some sad news,
we've concluded that it's not possible for us to hold our Portland or Prague conferences in person this year.
There is just too much risk of a safety issue for our community for us to consider holding the events in our lovely venues.

Our new plan
------------

That said, we're not going away completely.
We all need something to look forward to,
and we're hoping to be able to provide our community with a gathering place in the best way that we can.

**We're planning to hold an online event, with a new format, sometime near our new conference dates in August**. 
We will be releasing additional details as we confirm them.

We're looking at ways we can continue to offer the core parts of our events,
re-imagined in digital form while keeping our community spirit:

* Writing Day, where the community comes together and works on projects and learns from each other. We hope that we can hold a remote Writing Day that still has folks collaborating on docs
* Unconference, where our community has discussions and shares ideas. We think our Slack network already approximates this pretty well, but we're hoping to have more structure and moderation during some kind of official event
* Presentations, where we share ideas, insights, and best practices. We should be able to stream these to a larger audience across the world, and be able to include some real-time Q&A with our speakers
* Job Fair, where our attendees and sponsors come together to find a match. We're hoping to expand on top of our Job Board, offering our sponsors the ability to showcase the work they're doing and what they're hiring for. 

We haven't found good ways to do our Hike or Boat Ride online, so you'll just have to enjoy a small bit of the woods and water on our behalf.

Benefits that come from the new reality
---------------------------------------

We are sad not to be able to have our upcoming events in person,
but we also want to note that there are some benefits to moving online.
People who haven't been able to travel to our events will still be able to speak and attend, making the event more accessible to everyone.
We're also gaining the knowledge around having events online,
which we hope to continue into the future in some form even when we can meet again.

We're working to give you something on your calendar to get excited about,
and we're getting excited to get back to work sharing knowledge within our community.
