Write the Docs 2019 Stats
=========================

Since it's quiet over the holidays,
we normally don't do a newsletter in January.
Instead,
we send out a yearly update for the Write the Docs community,
filling you in on our progress.

Community Updates
-----------------

We have a few outstanding things that we wanted to update you on,
coming into 2020.

The first big change is the `Write the Docs Enhancement Proposals (WEPs) <https://github.com/writethedocs/weps/>`_ process that we have implemented.
We have approved WEP0_,
which defines the process,
and we will be running more proposals through this process soon.
We hope that you will provide your feedback and insight to us as we look to guide the community into the future.

The second major thing is :doc:`another US conference </conf/cfp/east-2020>` closer to the east coast.
We've still in the process of talking with venues and trying to see if will work for 2020.
We will let everyone know the status of the event _before_ Portland tickets sell out,
so that you won't miss your chance to attend.

The last major thing is our :doc:`Salary Survey </surveys/salary-survey-sep-2019>`,
which finished up in November.
This is the first year that we've done this,
and we were blown away by the response.
We had over 700 people fill it out,
and we're in the process of sifting through the data to provide some insights.
We plan to release the full results soon,
and in the future hopefully we will have a smoother process for this in place to get it turned around faster.
