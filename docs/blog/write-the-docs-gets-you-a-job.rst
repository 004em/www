Write the Docs gets you a job
=============================

Write the Docs is a community for everyone who cares about documentation.
Over time,
we have brought together people from myriad companies and job titles to share in their passion for communication and helping users.
Our in person and online spaces provide a wonderful place to learn best practices around documentation.
Because of this,
we have attracted a large number of people at the forefront in thinking around documentation.
These best practices continue to push the industry forward,
shared through our conferences and online spaces.

Along with pushing the industry forward,
we know that each person in our community is also trying to push their career forward.
People in our community want to work with forward thinking companies.
They want coworkers who *get it*,
who care about their customers as much as they do.
We have been seeing this happen organically in our *#jobs* channel in Slack for years now,
and now we're launching two efforts to connect great folks with great companies.

The Job Board
-------------

We are launching a new Job Board: http://jobs.writethedocs.org.
It fulfills two primary roles:

* Allows employers to post jobs
* Allows employees to get alerted when jobs are posted

In order to get jobs out to our full community,
we'll also be highlighting some of the jobs in our Newsletter and in the *#jobs* channel in Slack.

Job postings are currently priced:

* $50 for a basic job posting (posted to the Web, Slack, and Email)
* $150 for a promoted job posting (also included in our Newsletter)

We're excited to have this ability to conenct our community with jobs.
We truly believe that the folks in our community are pushign the industry forward,
and helping to facilitate this activity will make only make documentaiton in the software industry get better even quicker!

We're also formalizing the hiring processes at our conference this year,
but doing a job fair.

The Job Fair at Conferences
---------------------------

Along with our online Job Board,
we'll be doing a Job Fair at our conferences this year.
We have a number of companies that sponsor our conference each year,
and most of them care a lot about docs,
and are hiring folks to help make them better!

The Job Fair is the place where you can actually talk with folks at a company about the jobs that they have open.
Have questions about the culture,
the tools,
or anything else?
You can chat with folks working at the company during the job fair!

We'll be doing a Job Fair at the **Portland** and **Prague** conferences this year.
They will be around 2 hours long,
and be in a similar format to the Unconference.
Each company will get a table where you can chat with them about the jobs they have available.

The job fair is included with our larger conference sponsorships,
but pricing details can be found in our sponsorship prospectus:

* `Portland sponsorship details`_ 
* `Prague sponsorship details`_

Improvements
------------

Both of these initiatives are new this year.
We're still experimenting with how to make them valuable for everyone involved.
If you have any specific changes that we could make,
you can email us at jobs@writethedocs.org with suggestions.
