Find your dream job with Write the Docs
=======================================

Since the very first Write the Docs conference,
we have been connecting documentarians with companies that need people to solve documentation-related problems.
Over time,
we have brought together people from myriad companies and job titles to share in their passion for communication and helping users.
Our in person and online spaces provide a wonderful place to learn best practices around documentation.
Because of this,
we have attracted a group of folks who are doing some of the most interesting and innovative work around software documentation.
Everywhere the community interacts, 
whether at our offline events or in our online spaces,
it's easy to see the profession's best practices evolve and improve. 

Along with pushing the industry forward,
we know that each person in our community is also trying to push their career forward.
People in our community want to work with forward thinking companies.
They want coworkers who *get it*,
who care about their customers as much as they do.
We have been seeing this happen organically in our *#jobs* channel in Slack for years now,
and now we're launching two efforts – 
an online job board and an in-person job fair – 
to connect great folks with great companies.

The Job Board
-------------

We are launching a new Job Board: http://jobs.writethedocs.org.
It has two simple functions:

* Employers can post job openings
* Candidates search for and be notified about available positions 

In order to get jobs out to our full community,
we'll also be highlighting some of the jobs in our Newsletter and in the *#jobs* channel in Slack.

Job postings are currently priced as follows:

* $50 for a basic job posting (posted to the Web, Slack, and Email)
* $150 for a promoted job posting (also included in our Newsletter)

We're excited to have more and better ways to connect people, 
and we're confident that this will move us towards our goal to improve documentation in the software industry.

We're also formalizing the hiring processes at our conference this year,
by doing a job fair.

The Job Fair at Conferences
---------------------------

Along with our online Job Board,
we'll be doing a Job Fair at our conferences this year.
We have a number of companies that sponsor our conference each year,
and most of them care a lot about docs,
and are hiring folks to help make them better!

The Job Fair is the place where you can actually talk with folks at a company about the jobs that they have open.
Have questions about the culture,
the tools,
or anything else?
You can chat with folks working at the company during the job fair!

We'll be doing a Job Fair at the **Portland** and **Prague** conferences this year.
They will be around 2 hours long,
and be in a similar format to the Unconference.
Each company will get a table where you can chat with them about the jobs they have available.

The job fair is included with our larger conference sponsorships,
but pricing details can be found in our sponsorship prospectus:

* `Portland sponsorship details`_ 
* `Prague sponsorship details`_

Improvements
------------

Both of these initiatives are new this year.
We're still experimenting with how to make them valuable for everyone involved.
If you have any specific changes that we could make,
you can email us at jobs@writethedocs.org with suggestions.
