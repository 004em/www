Write the Docs 2017 Stats
=========================

2016 was a wonderful year for Write the Docs, it marks our 5th year of existence,
and the community is growing into a truly global community.
This post covers a few stats and tidbits of information that we feel mark our progress,
and we'll also have a companion post that gives a bit more commentary!

.. note:: You can also read our post from :doc:`2016 <blog/write-the-docs-2017-year-in-review>`

Conferences
===========

* 400 attendees in Portland (Same in 2016)
* 250 attendees in Prague (Same in 2016)
* 50 attendees in Australia (New)

The :doc:`conferences </conf/index>` continue to be the yearly physical manifestation of our community.
They are the time each year where hundreds of wonderful folks gather and have a great time,
while learning so much from each other.
Proving each year that work can be both fun and informative is one of my greatest pleasures.

We continue to publish :doc:`videos </videos>` freely to the public.
This is done so that the information can be most widely shared,
and help people who may not be able to attend the events.
Write the Docs always strives to be as inclusive as possible,
and continuing to publish these videos is part of our commitment to openness.

Slack Network
=============

* 3,000 (was 1,200 members in 2016)

* 4 Continents (same in 2016)

Our :doc:`meetup community </meetups/index>` has continued to grow across the globe.

Podcast

The podcast has been doing consistent work again this year!

This is a new stat for this year, but we have historical data in Google Analytics to compare against.

Thanks
======

At every conference I make it a point to thank the attendees.
People who believe in our community are the ones who make it happen.
So thank you to everyone who has been a part of making this community something that keeps growing and evolving.
I've been humbled by the empathy and wonderfulness of this community,
and all I can hope is that we continue to strive to be as helpful and welcoming as possible.

Here's to another wonderful year.
