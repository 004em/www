Starting a Meetup
=================

Interested in fostering a lovely gathering of documentarians in your neck of the woods?
This is the place to start!

The first thing you'll want to do is watch this video about starting a meetup.
It contains a lot of the knowledge that we have put here:

Write the Docs Worldview
------------------------

Our worldview is important for starting a meetup.
We aren't just another tech writing meetup,
but hope to be welcoming to the vast parts of the tech industry that care about documentation.

Eric Holscher's Introduction to the conference and community from the Write the Docs 2016 event in Portland is a good place to start.
We highly recommend watching this before starting a meetup!

.. note:: You can skip ahead to 1:30, since the beginning is mostly conference logistics.

Done? Let's go into details.

Launch your Meetup Page
-----------------------

Write the Docs meetups are organized though `Meetup <http://www.meetup.com/>`_. Using this service, you'll be able to create events with registration, easily contact people in you group, promote your sponsors, etc. It costs money but the good news is that we can help you: `contact us <mailto:conf@writethedocs.org>`_ when you've launched your Meetup page to be reimburse.

How to Start your Group?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go to `Meetup website <https://secure.meetup.com/create/>`_ and follow the instructions.

a few tips:

* **Topics**: they're keywords associated with your group that will help people find it. If you're not sure what to choose, you can try: Technical Writers, Documentation, Technical Writing, Technical communicators, Technical Documentation Editing, Writing, Document Management Systems, Software Development, Web Development, User Experience, UX Design, Open Source.
* **Name**: our meetups are usually called "Write the Docs" + city name.
* **Members' name**: meetup's organizers usually choose "Documentarians".
* **Code of Conduct**: don't forget to add Write the Docs' :doc:`/code-of-conduct` to the ``page`` section of your meetup.

If you need more help, you can check `Meetup's documentation <http://www.meetup.com/help/topics/10/article/464982/>`_.

When you're done, `contact us <mailto:conf@writethedocs.org>`_: we will add your group to the :doc:`/meetups/index` list on our website.

How to Find a Place to Meet (Sponsors)?
---------------------------------------

Who and Where to ask?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can start to ask companies you're close to: it could be your company, your friends companies, etc.

If it's not working, you can contact other tech companies in your town. Job boards, Tech conferences websites, and other tech meetups are a good way to start.

It's always easier to know someone inside the company you want to contact. If you don't have one, you can use this email template:

.. code-block:: jinja

    Hello,

    My name is {{ name }} and I am the organizer of Write the Docs
    {{ city name }} meetup {{ link to meetup page }}. Write the Docs
    {{ writethedocs.org }} is a global community of technical writers,
    designers, typesetters, developers, support teams, marketers and
    many others interested in documentation.

    We're looking for a sponsor to host our {{ first/next }} meetup.
    This could be a great opportunity to reach new writers and to
    develop your team skills.

    If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

    Regards,
    {{ name }}

Logistic
~~~~~~~~

Depending on what you're planing, you may need:

* Electricity and enough outlets or cords for everyone.
* A good Internet connection: print small posters with wifi's name and password or write it somewhere visible.
* A projector: always bring Mac adapters with you in case the speakers forget it.
* Food and/or beverages: always have non-alcoholic beverages and vegetarian options.

To help people find your meetup place, prepare a small poster to hang on the front door with the name of your meetup and basic info ("2nd floor on the right", entry code, etc).

Try to have a venue accessible to people with disabilities: point out in your event description if it's the case or not.

Can't find a place to meet?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It can be difficult to find a place for your first meetup. If it's the case, don't worry, and try something else: you can meet in a cafe, organize a picnic, do an "after-work" in a bar.

You can also ask around on social media or `WTD Slack <http://slack.writethedocs.org>`_: one person there may be able to help you find a place for your next meetup.


.. TODO:

    How to reach new members?
    -------------------------

    Create social media accounts. Advertise your next meetup on WTD slack, forum or mailing list.
    Go to other meetups to present yours.

    Go to company booth during events to tell them about your meetup.

    Don't forget to ask if people want to help you: organizing alone can be really hard and time-consuming.


    What to do during a meetup?
    ---------------------------

    Talks. Multiple formats: 20 minutes, 40 minutes, lightning talks, etc.
    Talk proposal preparation.
    Networking.
    Learning new skills/tools.
    If you want to find a list of topics: check other `WTD meetups <http://meetup.com/pro/writethedocs>`_.

    How to find speakers?
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Look at previous conferences, meetup around you.
    CFP: invite your members to talk!
