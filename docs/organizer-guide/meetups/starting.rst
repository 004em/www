Starting a Meetup
=================

Interested in fostering a lovely gathering of documentarians in your neck of the woods?
This is the place to start!

The first thing you'll want to do is watch this video about starting a meetup.
It contains a lot of the knowledge that we have put here:

Write the Docs Worldview
------------------------

Our worldview is important for starting a meetup.
We aren't just another tech writing meetup,
but hope to be welcoming to the vast parts of the tech industry that care about documentation.

Eric Holscher's Introduction to the conference and community from the Write the Docs 2016 event in Portland is a good place to start.
We highly recommend watching this before starting a meetup!

.. note:: You can skip ahead to 1:30, since the beginning is mostly conference logistics.

Done? Let's go into details.

Launch your Group
-----------------

Write the Docs meetups are organized using `Meetup <http://www.meetup.com/>`_. Through Meetup, you can create events, contact Meetup members, promote your sponsors, and more. If you need help with Meetup fees, `contact us <mailto:conf@writethedocs.org>`_. We may be able to help.

Create a Meetup Page:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go to `Meetup website <https://secure.meetup.com/create/>`_ and follow the instructions.

a few tips:

* **Topics**: they're keywords associated with your group that will help people find it. If you're not sure what to choose, you can try: Technical Writers, Documentation, Technical Writing, Technical communicators, Technical Documentation Editing, Writing, Document Management Systems, Software Development, Web Development, User Experience, UX Design, Open Source.
* **Name**: our meetups are usually called "Write the Docs" + city name.
* **Members' name**: meetup's organizers usually choose "Documentarians".
* **Code of Conduct**: don't forget to add Write the Docs' :doc:`/code-of-conduct` to the ``page`` section of your meetup.

If you need more help, you can check `Meetup's documentation <http://www.meetup.com/help/topics/10/article/464982/>`_.

When you're done, `contact us <mailto:conf@writethedocs.org>`_ or on `Slack <https://writethedocs.slack.com/>`_: we will add your group to the :doc:`/meetups/index` list on our website.

Find a Place to Meet (Sponsors)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Start to ask companies you're close to: it could be your company, your friends' companies, etc.

If it's not working, contact other tech companies in your town. Job boards, Tech conferences websites, and other tech meetups are also a good way to start.

It's easier to know someone inside the company you want to contact. If you don't know anyone, you can use this email template:

.. code-block:: jinja

    Hello,

    My name is {{ name }} and I am the organizer of Write the Docs
    {{ city name }} meetup {{ link to meetup page }}. Write the Docs
    {{ writethedocs.org }} is a global community of technical writers,
    designers, typesetters, developers, support teams, marketers and
    many others interested in documentation.

    We're looking for a sponsor to host our {{ first/next }} meetup.
    This could be a great opportunity to reach new writers and to
    develop your team skills.

    If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

    Regards,
    {{ name }}

Can't Find a Place to Meet?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you can't find a company to host your meetup, try something different: `meet in a cafe <http://www.meetup.com/Write-The-Docs-Seattle/events/231890982/>`_ to work on a common project, organize a picnic or do an "after-work" in a bar. Networking is an important part of meetups and it's better to meet every month than to skip one because you didn't find a sponsor.

If you're having difficulty finding a location, ask on the `Slack <http://slack.writethedocs.org>`_: you have an international community ready to help.

---------------------------

Logistic
--------

Meetup's Event Page:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Provide a `description <http://www.meetup.com/Write-The-Docs-PDX/events/231735823/>`_ of your event's topic, a `schedule <http://www.meetup.com/Write-the-Docs-SF/events/232289251/>`_, info on where to meet and, if relevant, a short `speakers' bio <http://www.meetup.com/Write-The-Docs-London/events/231780773/>`_.

Checklist:
~~~~~~~~~~

Depending on your meetup, here's a list of what you may need:

* Electricity and enough power outlets for everyone.
* A good Internet connection: make the network name and password available. If possible, write it somewhere visible so you don't have to repeat it all the time.
* A projector: have adapters available for speakers or ask them to bring one.
* Food and/or beverages: include non-alcoholic and vegetarian options.

Venue:
~~~~~~

To help people find your meetup venue:

* Include directions in the event description.
* Ask your host to add direction signs with your meetup name in appropriate locations.

Try to have a venue accessible to people with disabilities: point out in your event description if it's the case or not.

When your Meetup is Over
------------------------

* Send a thank you email to your speakers and ask them to post their slides in your event's comments.
* Send a thank you email to the company who hosted you.
* If you took pictures, post them on your meetup page. If you plan to do that, always ask people if they're okay with being on a picture that will be published online.
* If you have a Twitter account: do a tweet to thank everyone who came, your speakers and your sponsor. If your speakers posted their slides online, retweet them.


.. TODO:

    How to reach new members?
    -------------------------

    Create social media accounts. Advertise your next meetup on WTD slack, forum or mailing list.
    Go to other meetups to present yours.

    Go to company booth during events to tell them about your meetup.

    Don't forget to ask if people want to help you: organizing alone can be really hard and time-consuming.


    What to do during a meetup?
    ---------------------------

    Talks. Multiple formats: 20 minutes, 40 minutes, lightning talks, etc.
    Talk proposal preparation.
    Networking.
    Learning new skills/tools.
    If you want to find a list of topics: check other `WTD meetups <http://meetup.com/pro/writethedocs>`_.

    How to find speakers?
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
