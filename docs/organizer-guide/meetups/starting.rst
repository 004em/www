Starting a Meetup
=================

Interested in fostering a lovely gathering of documentarians in your neck of the woods?
This is the place to start!

The first thing you'll want to do is watch this video about starting a meetup.
It contains a lot of the knowledge that we have put here:

Write the Docs Worldview
------------------------

Our worldview is important for starting a meetup.
We aren't just another tech writing meetup,
but hope to be welcoming to the vast parts of the tech industry that care about documentation.

Eric Holscher's Introduction to the conference and community from the Write the Docs 2016 event in Portland is a good place to start.
We highly recommend watching this before starting a meetup!

.. note:: You can skip ahead to 1:30, since the beginning is mostly conference logistics.

Done? Let's go into details.

Launch your Meetup Page
-----------------------

Write the Docs meetups are organized using `Meetup <http://www.meetup.com/>`_. Through Meetup, you can create events, contact Meetup members, promote your sponsors, and more. If you need help with Meetup fees, `contact us <mailto:conf@writethedocs.org>`_. We may be able to help.

How to Start your Group?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go to `Meetup website <https://secure.meetup.com/create/>`_ and follow the instructions.

a few tips:

* **Topics**: they're keywords associated with your group that will help people find it. If you're not sure what to choose, you can try: Technical Writers, Documentation, Technical Writing, Technical communicators, Technical Documentation Editing, Writing, Document Management Systems, Software Development, Web Development, User Experience, UX Design, Open Source.
* **Name**: our meetups are usually called "Write the Docs" + city name.
* **Members' name**: meetup's organizers usually choose "Documentarians".
* **Code of Conduct**: don't forget to add Write the Docs' :doc:`/code-of-conduct` to the ``page`` section of your meetup.

If you need more help, you can check `Meetup's documentation <http://www.meetup.com/help/topics/10/article/464982/>`_.

When you're done, `contact us <mailto:conf@writethedocs.org>`_ or on `Slack <https://writethedocs.slack.com/>`_: we will add your group to the :doc:`/meetups/index` list on our website.

How to Find a Place to Meet (Sponsors)?
---------------------------------------

Who and Where to ask?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Start to ask companies you're close to: it could be your company, your friends' companies, etc.

If it's not working, contact other tech companies in your town. Job boards, Tech conferences websites, and other tech meetups are also a good way to start.

It's easier to know someone inside the company you want to contact. If you don't know anyone, you can use this email template:

.. code-block:: jinja

    Hello,

    My name is {{ name }} and I am the organizer of Write the Docs
    {{ city name }} meetup {{ link to meetup page }}. Write the Docs
    {{ writethedocs.org }} is a global community of technical writers,
    designers, typesetters, developers, support teams, marketers and
    many others interested in documentation.

    We're looking for a sponsor to host our {{ first/next }} meetup.
    This could be a great opportunity to reach new writers and to
    develop your team skills.

    If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

    Regards,
    {{ name }}

Checklist:
^^^^^^^^^^

Depending on your meetup, here's a list of what you may need:

* Electricity and enough power outlets for everyone.
* A good Internet connection: make the network name and password available. If possible, write it somewhere visible so you don't have to repeat it all the time.
* A projector: have adapters available for speakers or ask them to bring one.
* Food and/or beverages: include non-alcoholic and vegetarian options.

Venue:
^^^^^^

To help people find your meetup venue:

* Include directions in the event description.
* Ask your host to add direction signs with your meetup name in appropriate locations.

Try to have a venue accessible to people with disabilities: point out in your event description if it's the case or not.

Can't find a place to meet?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you can't find a company to host your meetup, don't worry: you can meet in a cafe, organize a picnic, do an "after-work" in a bar.

If you're having difficulty finding a location, ask on the `Slack <http://slack.writethedocs.org>`_: you have an international community ready to help.


.. TODO:

    How to reach new members?
    -------------------------

    Create social media accounts. Advertise your next meetup on WTD slack, forum or mailing list.
    Go to other meetups to present yours.

    Go to company booth during events to tell them about your meetup.

    Don't forget to ask if people want to help you: organizing alone can be really hard and time-consuming.

    ---------------------------

    Talks. Multiple formats: 20 minutes, 40 minutes, lightning talks, etc.
    Talk proposal preparation.
    Networking.
    Learning new skills/tools.
    If you want to find a list of topics: check other `WTD meetups <http://meetup.com/pro/writethedocs>`_.

    How to find speakers?
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Look at previous conferences, meetup around you.
