Write the Docs Worldview
------------------------

Yes, Write the Docs has a worldview.
We include everyone who is interested in excellent documentation: tech writers, developers, engineers, QA, product managers, support engineers and more.

For more information on the Write the Docs worldview, see Eric Holscher's Introduction to the conference and community from Write the Docs NA 2016:

.. note:: The "meat" of the worldview starts at 1:30.

Now for some details

Launch your Group
-----------------

You can start a Write the Docs Meetup via `Meetup <http://www.meetup.com/>`_. Through Meetup.com, you can create events, contact Meetup members, promote your sponsors, and more. If you need help with Meetup fees, `contact us <mailto:conf@writethedocs.org>`_. We may be able to help.

Create a Meetup Page:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go to the `Meetup website <https://secure.meetup.com/create/>`_ and follow the instructions.

Tips:

* **Topics**: Choose your topics with an eye to the Write The Docs worldview. We want to include everyoen interested in software documentation, so include topics that help publicize your meetups to the developers and engineers in your area, such as Python, JavaScript, APIs, Perl, Ruby, UX, User Experience, as well as standard topics associated with techincal writing.
* **Name**: Our meetup include the following standard name: "Write the Docs" <city name>, such as "Write The Docs PDX".
* **Members' name**: Our standard name is "Documentarian".
* **Code of Conduct**: Do include a code of conduct. For options, see the stadnard Write the Docs' :doc:`/code-of-conduct` or the abbreviated version used by `Write the Docs PDX <https://www.meetup.com/Write-The-Docs-PDX/pages/19618086/Code_of_Conduct/>`_

Once you've started your Meetup, `contact us by email <mailto:conf@writethedocs.org>`_ or on `Slack <https://writethedocs.slack.com/>`_: we will add your group to the :doc:`/meetups/index` list on our website.

Find a Place to Meet
--------------------

Ideally, you can start by setting up a Meetup at your corporate facility. If your facilities aren't convenient to your potential community of documentarians, find "documentarians" or "community managers" for centrally located companies in your area. You can typically find these people at other technical meetups/conferences in your area.

Alternatively, the electronic version of "cold-calling" can work. We provide this email template for your reference:

.. code-block:: jinja

Troubleshooting

Meetups don't always happen in the way you planned. The following list include
problems that you may encounter:

What happens when your speaker cancels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a speaker cancels, think of it as an opportunity! While it's not convenient,
it's your chance to get others to participate. Here's one approach:

Go around the "table". Ask each attendee to:

1) Introduce themselves

2) Cite one major problem they have. Make notes.

3) After the introductions are complete, ask people to comment on each problem.

After Your Meetup
-----------------

* Send a thank you note to your speakers. Ask them to post their slides.
* Send a thank you note to your hostyou.
* Post pictures on your meetup page. Be sure to get permission.
* Use Twitter account to thank your attendees, speakers and sponsor.
