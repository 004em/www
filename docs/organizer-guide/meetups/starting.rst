Starting a Meetup
=================

Interested in fostering a lovely gathering of documentarians in your neck of the woods?
This is the place to start!

The first thing you'll want to do is watch this video about starting a meetup.
It contains a lot of the knowledge that we have put here:

Write the Docs Worldview
------------------------

Our worldview is important for starting a meetup.
We aren't just another tech writing meetup,
but hope to be welcoming to the vast parts of the tech industry that care about documentation.

Eric Holscher's Introduction to the conference and community from the Write the Docs 2016 event in Portland is a good place to start.
We highly recommend watching this before starting a meetup!

.. note:: You can skip ahead to 1:30, since the beginning is mostly conference logistics.

Done? Let's go into details.

Launch your Group
-----------------

Write the Docs meetups are organized using `Meetup <http://www.meetup.com/>`_. Through Meetup, you can create events, contact Meetup members, promote your sponsors, and more. If you need help with Meetup fees, `contact us <mailto:conf@writethedocs.org>`_. We may be able to help.

Create a Meetup Page:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go to `Meetup website <https://secure.meetup.com/create/>`_ and follow the instructions.

a few tips:

* **Topics**: they're keywords associated with your group that will help people find it. If you're not sure what to choose, you can try: Technical Writers, Documentation, Technical Writing, Technical communicators, Technical Documentation Editing, Writing, Document Management Systems, Software Development, Web Development, User Experience, UX Design, Open Source.
* **Name**: our meetups are usually called "Write the Docs" + city name.
* **Members' name**: meetup's organizers usually choose "Documentarians".
* **Code of Conduct**: don't forget to add Write the Docs' :doc:`/code-of-conduct` to the ``page`` section of your meetup.

If you need more help, you can check `Meetup's documentation <http://www.meetup.com/help/topics/10/article/464982/>`_.

When you're done, `contact us <mailto:conf@writethedocs.org>`_ or on `Slack <https://writethedocs.slack.com/>`_: we will add your group to the :doc:`/meetups/index` list on our website.

Find a Place to Meet (Sponsors)
-------------------------------

Start to ask companies you're close to: it could be your company, your friends' companies, etc.

If it's not working, contact other tech companies in your town. Job boards, tech conferences websites, and other tech meetups are also a good way to start. If you're going to tech conferences, go to sponsors booth and ask them if they would be interested in sponsoring your meetup.

It's easier to know someone inside the company you want to contact. If you don't know anyone, you can use this email template:

.. code-block:: jinja

    Hello,

    My name is {{ name }} and I am the organizer of Write the Docs
    {{ city name }} meetup {{ link to meetup page }}. Write the Docs
    {{ writethedocs.org }} is a global community of technical writers,
    designers, typesetters, developers, support teams, marketers and
    many others interested in documentation.

    We're looking for a sponsor to host our {{ first/next }} meetup.
    This could be a great opportunity to reach new writers and to
    develop your team skills.

    If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

    Regards,
    {{ name }}

Can't Find a Place to Meet?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you can't find a company to host your meetup, try something different: `meet in a cafe <http://www.meetup.com/Write-The-Docs-Seattle/events/231890982/>`_ to work on a common project, organize a picnic or do an "after-work" in a bar. Networking is an important part of meetups and it's better to meet every month than to skip one because you didn't find a sponsor.

If you're having difficulty finding a location, ask on the `Slack <http://slack.writethedocs.org>`_: you have an international community ready to help.

Find attendees and speakers
---------------------------

Attendees:
~~~~~~~~~~

Once your meetup page is up, start promoting it. To do that:

* Announce your meetup on `Write the Docs Slack <https://writethedocs.slack.com>`_ and join meetup-organizers and meetup-general channels. You can also create a dedicated channel to your meetup.
* Announce your meetup on `Write the Docs Forum <http://forum.writethedocs.org/c/meetups>`_.
* Create a Twitter account and connect it to your meetup's page (`example <https://twitter.com/WriteTheDocsPDX/>`_). Use it to announce your next events, live tweet your meetup, post pictures, reach new people, retweet other Write the Docs meetups, etc.
* Use your network: ask your colleagues, friends and contacts to promote your meetup.
* Reach new people: find other community leaders and ask them to spread the word.
* Attend other meetups in your area and network.
* Add your meetup to local tech events calendars (`example <http://calagator.org/events/1250470345>`_).

Be active, friendly and people will want to attend your meetup.

No-show:
^^^^^^^^

A lot of people RSVPed but didn't show? Don't worry, that's one of the downsides of free meetups. Do a head-count at each events to know how many people usually attend your meetup.

If something went wrong, listen to feedback and make changes. Try to have a different topic and speakers for each meetup: if you don't do that, people will get bored and won't come anymore.

Depending on your meetup, here's a list of what you may need:

* Electricity and enough power outlets for everyone.
* A good Internet connection: make the network name and password available. If possible, write it somewhere visible so you don't have to repeat it all the time.
* A projector: have adapters available for speakers or ask them to bring one.
* Food and/or beverages: include non-alcoholic and vegetarian options.

Try to have a venue accessible to people with disabilities: point out in your event description if it's the case or not.

* Arrive early to your meetup venue.
* Ask your host to add direction signs with your meetup name in appropriate locations.
* Greet everyone and make them feel welcome.

* Send a thank you email to your speakers and ask them to post their slides in your event's comments.
* Send a thank you email to the company who hosted you.
* If you took pictures, post them on your meetup page. If you plan to do that, always ask people if they're okay with being on a picture that will be published online.

    -------------------------

    Create social media accounts. Advertise your next meetup on WTD slack, forum or mailing list.

    Go to company booth during events to tell them about your meetup.

    Don't forget to ask if people want to help you: organizing alone can be really hard and time-consuming.
