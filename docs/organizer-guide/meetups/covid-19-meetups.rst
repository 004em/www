Meetups and COVID-19
====================

With the recent announcement about the Write The Docs Portland conference, we wanted to provide guidance for our community of meetups.

We've received a number of questions about whether Write the Docs community meetups should continue to host in-person events under the current circumstances related to the spread of COVID-19.

For the meetup organizers among us, we urge you to follow the best information available from your local, state, provincial, and national governments, including health advisories. If they are discouraging in-person events, we urge you to follow their advice.

If you and your groups wish to continue to meet, please consider using available remote tools in whole or part. That will help us, as a community, to be more inclusive of those who are not able or willing to attend in person.

If you have any questions, donâ€™t hesitate to message us in the `#meetup-organisers <https://writethedocs.slack.com/messages/meetup-organisers/>`_ Slack channel. We'll do our best to address your concerns.

If you need advice on remote meetups, we have members with expertise in the `#wtd-meetup-remote <https://writethedocs.slack.com/messages/wtd-meetup-remote/>`_ Slack channel.
