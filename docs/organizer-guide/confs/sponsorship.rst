Sponsorships
============

Write the Docs has a specific view around sponsorship.
More concretely,
we believe that the community comes first,
and that sponsors are accomodated after that.

Keeping this philsophy in mind will make the rest of this document make sense,
as it's the root belief that everything stems from.

Hard Rules
----------

We have these rules around sponsorship:

* Sponsors can't buy talk slots at our conferences. Any time sponsors will be on stage will be labeled as a sponsorship time.
* We don't sell personal information about our attendees to sponsors (eg. to add to their mailing list).
