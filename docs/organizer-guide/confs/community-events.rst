Community Events
================

We are happy to promote events that are created by our community.
They are **not** officially organized by Write the Docs organizers,
but they are sister events that share a similar goal.

Requirements
------------

In order to be listed as a community event,
we require a few things.
This is primarily to make sure people understand who is organizing the event,
and to make sure companies can't run events inside our community for their own profit.

Community events:

* Must have a Code of Conduct
* Must specify they **are not** official Write the Docs events, but must link back to Write the Docs as a refenence to the community
* Must list the organizers, and they must be from multiple companies
