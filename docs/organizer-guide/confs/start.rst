I Want to Run a Write the Docs conference, Now What?
====================================================

We have two guidelines that you should always adhere to when thinking about
starting your own Write the Docs event:

* **You must have attended a Write the Docs conference.**

  We do this to ensure that you know what a "Write the Docs event" means, for
  better or for worse. We run these events as not-for-profit experiments where
  we try to isolate the things that work well and remove, anything that degrades
  the experience. We take risks where others might be cautious, we focus on
  shared social experiences, and we do our best to make a difference in the
  community.

  Reading about this philosophy second-hand just doesn't convey the full scope of
  how we operate.

* **You must have an established Write the Docs organizer onboard for guidance.**

  We run Write the Docs events as a franchise model where the local team are in
  control. They arrange the schedule, scope out the venue, plan the parties, and
  organize everything else. This gives the event a local feel which is part of
  what makes it special: if you attend Write the Docs US and Write the Docs
  Europe you will find significant differences -- and that is intentional.

  We have this guideline so we can ensure that the conference is organized in
  a way that is compatible with the other Write the Docs events.

There are many people that would love to run a Write the Docs event, but it is
important to realize that life is not all roses on the organizational side. If
you are going to run a Write the Docs event, it is important that you understand
what it means to the community, sometimes it is better to run a "Write the Docs
like" event with a different name. `Reach out to us
<mailto:conf@writethedocs.org>`__, and we will help as much as we can and you want --
we want more events to happen all over the world.
