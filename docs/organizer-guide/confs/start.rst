I Want to Run a Write the Docs conference, Now What?
====================================================

We have two rules for starting an event using the name "Write the Docs".
They are rather simple,
but critical to how we operate:

* **You must have attended an existing Write the Docs conference.** 
    We do this to ensure that you know what a "Write the Docs event" means,
    for better or for worse.
    We run these events as not-for-profit experiments where we try to isolate the things that work well and reduce,
    if not remove,
    the items that degrade the experience.
    We take risks where others might be cautious,
    we focus on shared social experiences,
    and we do our best to make a difference in the community.
    Reading about it second-hand just doesn't convey the full scope of this,
    which is why we require that people looking to start a new Write the Docs have attended an existing one.
* **You must have an existing Write the Docs organizer as oversight.**
    We essentially treat the Write the Docs event as a franchise model where the event is run entirely by the local individual or team.
    They arrange the schedule,
    they plan out the venue,
    the parties,
    and everything else.
    This gives the event a very local feeling to it which makes it very special,
    if you were to attend Write the Docs US and Write the Docs EU without knowing they were "Write the Docs" you would most likely think they are completely disjoint -- and that is intentional.
    We have this oversight clause just to ensure that
    1.) the conference isn't taken in a direction that is befitting the other Write the Docs events and
    2.) provide a single responsible person to help with questions regarding venue,
    speakers,
    budgeting,
    and how to manage everything.
    The most important job of the overseeing organizer is to provide a view that isn't deep in the planning and be there to say "It will work out, don't worry".

There are many people that think it would be great to run a Write the Docs and I definitely understand how it might seem from the outside,
but it is not all roses on the organization side.
If you are going to run a Write the Docs,
it (for better or worse) already means something to the community,
most times it is better to run a "Write the Docs like" event with a different name.
If you `reach out to us <mailto:conf@writethedocs.org>`__,
we will help as much as we can and you want
-- we want more events to happen all over the
world.

We are trying to bring a Write the Docs event near you,
we promise.
Unfortunately,
since we are this loose federation of folks that also have day jobs (and families),
we are limited in the amount of time we can spend and risk we can undertake with venue commitments,
travel costs,
etc.
If you want an event like `Write the Docs <http://www.writethedocs.org>`_,
send us an email and/or meet us at one of the events.Â
