Done? Let's go into details.

Launch your meetup page
-----------------------

`Meetup <http://www.meetup.com/>`_ is a web service that helps you organize regular events. It costs money but will make your life as an organizer much easier: you'll be able to create events with registration, easily contact people in you group, promote your sponsors, etc. Feel free to use another service if Meetup doesn't meet your needs.

How to launch your group?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to use Meetup, go to their `website <https://secure.meetup.com/create/>`_ and follow the instructions.

a few tips:

* **Topics**: they're keywords associated with your group that will help people find it. If you're not sure what to choose, you can try: Technical Writers, Documentation, Technical Writing, Technical communicators, Technical Documentation Editing, Writing, Software Development, Document Management Systems, User Experience, UX Design, Open Source.
* **Name**: our meetups are usually called "Write the Docs" + city name.
* **Members' name**: meetup's organizers usually choose "Documentarians".
* **Code of Conduct**: don't forget to add Write the Docs' :doc:`/code-of-conduct` to the "page" section of your meetup.

If you need more help, you can check `Meetup's documentation <http://www.meetup.com/help/topics/10/article/464982/>`_.

When you're done, `contact us <mailto:writethedocs@gmail.com>`_ so we can add your group to the :doc:`/meetups/index` list on our website.
