Our job fair is the dedicated space for folks looking to hire or be hired.
It will be structured in the same way as our unconference,
with tables around the room representing a specific company.

This to be a place where you can talk in more depth to folks who are looking to hire.
You can learn more about the culture at their company,
the specific openings and requirements for those jobs,
and all the other information that is much easier to get from talking to people!
