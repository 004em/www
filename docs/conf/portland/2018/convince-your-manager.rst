  RE: Continuous Improvement and Education

  I'd like to attend Write the Docs in Portland, 6-8 May 2018. This three-day event explores the art and science of documentation. The conference covers topics related to documentation in the software industry.

  Write the Docs brings everyone who writes the docs together in the same room: Writers, Developers, Developer Relations, and Support Staff, which makes it an ideal networking opportunity .

  There is a single track of talks, a parallel unconference event, and a writing day. The `sessions from 2017 <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2017/speakers/>`_ will give you a good idea of the diverse range of topics covered, many of which are relevant to my work.

  Costs:

  * Conference ticket (includes breakfast and lunch) - $450
  * Travel – [fill in with estimate]
  * Accomodation – – [fill in with estimate]

  Benefits:

  * Networking with other documentarians
  * Exposure to new or state-of-the-art ideas/techniques/products
  * Opportunity to contribute to discussions and working groups
  * Discovering solutions to problems I'm facing at work

  Thanks in advance,
  [your name]
