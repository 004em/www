  RE: Continuous Improvement and Education

  I'd like to attend Write the Docs in Portland, 6-8 May 2018. A three-day event that explores the art and science of documentation. The conference covers topics related to documentation in the software industry.

  Write the Docs brings everyone who writes the docs together in the same room: Writers, Developers, Developer Relations, and Support Staff, which makes it an ideal networking opportunity.

  There is a single talk track, a parallel unconference event and a writing day. The `sessions from 2017 <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2017/speakers/>`_ provide a reasonable idea of what to expect.

  Cost:

  * ticket $450
  * travel
  * accomodation

  Sincerely,
