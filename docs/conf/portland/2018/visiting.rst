Visiting Portland
=================

Wondering where to stay and how to get around once you get into Portland? The conference will be held at the `Crystal
Ballroom <http://www.mcmenamins.com/CrystalBallroom>`__, in downtown Portland, and most conference events will be held within just a few blocks of the Crystal Ballroom.

Eating
------

Portland is an amazing food city. Here are some resources that will help you find something good to eat:

- The `Easter 38 <http://pdx.eater.com/maps/best-portland-restaurants-38>`__ is a great resource for delightful food.
- Willamette Week's `Restaurant Guide <http://www.wweek.com/portland/restaurantguide>`__
- Urban Spoon's `Best of Portland <http://www.urbanspoon.com/c/24/Portland-restaurants.html>`__
- `Food Carts Portland <http://www.foodcartsportland.com/>`__


Where to stay
-------------

We are not working with any of the hotels for attendee accommodations, but there are many hotels available within walking distance of the venue:

- `Crystal Hotel <http://www.mcmenamins.com/CrystalHotel>`__
- `Ace Hotel <http://www.acehotel.com/portland>`__
- `Hotel DeLuxe <http://www.hoteldeluxeportland.com/>`__
- `Mark Spencer <http://www.markspencer.com/>`__
- `The Sentinel <http://www.sentinelhotel.com/>`__

How to get around
-----------------

Portland is a very accessible city and there are many transportation options available, public and otherwise.

The MAX
~~~~~~~

The `MAX <http://trimet.org/max>`__ is Portland's major light-rail system. The MAX primarily connects Portland with the surrounding cities, such as Gresham, Beaverton, Clackamas, and Hillsboro.

If you're flying into Portland Airport (PDX), we recommend taking the MAX into downtown Portland. There is a MAX station for the `red line <http://trimet.org/schedules/maxredline.htm>`__ in the airport itself.

The venue is along Burnside Street at 14th Ave, just east of the I-405 underpass. Normally the closest Red Line stop to the Crystal Ballroom would be at Galleria SW 10th.

Streetcars and Buses
--------------------
Portland has a `separate streetcar network <http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/>`__ which criss-crosses the MAX lines. These, along with Portland's extensive `bus network <http://trimet.org/bus/>`__, ought to suffice.

The streetcar loop lines are also under construction, but only through Saturday 14 May. This means their detours will only matter during the day of the hike. They may be your lifeline during the rest of the conference.

The streetcars run along 10th and 11th Avenues. The closest stops to the venue are also on Couch Street. There is also a Whole Foods Market at NW Couch & 12th Ave. See the `Streetcar Loop detour map <http://news.trimet.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Morrison-Yamhill-MAX-Improvements-Streetcar-Service-Map.png>`__ for details.

Taxi Companies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Portland has both Lyft and Uber, and they are quite popular. If you still prefer local taxi companies, here are a few recommendations:

- `Radio Cab <http://www.radiocab.net/>`__
- `Broadway Cab <http://www.broadwaycab.com/>`__
- `Portland Taxi <http://portlandtaxi.net/>`__

Please note that it is *not* common to hail taxis in Portland, and that your best bet is to call in advance.

Bike Rentals
~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two bike rental companies in downtown Portland that may be good options if you want to experience Portland by bike (which we very much recommend!):

- `Waterfront Bikes <http://www.waterfrontbikes.com/>`__
- `Cycle Portland <http://www.portlandbicycletours.com/>`__
