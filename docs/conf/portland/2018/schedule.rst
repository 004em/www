Schedule
========

Write the Docs is more than a conference.
Each year we organize a wide range of events so that people can come together, collaborate, and learn from each other in different ways.

Saturday, May 5th
-----------------

The only event scheduled on Saturday is the :doc:`annual hike to Pittock Mansion </conf/portland/2018/hike>`.
If you get into town early, join us on the hike and take the chance to explore Portland in all of its glory.

The hike starts at **2pm** on Saturday.

Sunday, May 6th
---------------

The Writing Day and Welcome Reception will be held at the **Crystal Ballroom located at 1332 W Burnside St**.

During the day, we'll hold our :doc:`Writing Day documentation sprints </conf/portland/2018/writing-day>`, followed by the conference
reception in the evening.

We encourage everyone to drop by on Sunday evening for the conference reception.
You'll have a chance to get acquainted with each other over some drinks and snacks.
We'll also help groups organize dinner plans, so you can continue your conversations over more substantial food as well.
