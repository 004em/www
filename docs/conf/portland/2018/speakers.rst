        <div class="talk-description">
            <p>Writers of software and writers of documentation practice a shared art: we bestow abstractions with names. We know weve succeeded when our names illuminate concepts, elicit a-ha moments, and empower users to put our product to work. We know we've failed when the names we've chosen confuse, frustrate, misguide, or offend.</p>
            <p>Naming things well matters. Too often, though, good names are hard to come by, and bad names are hard to change.</p>
            <p>Using a lengthy and ever-growing list of Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad names encountered during my career as an engineer, this talk will address:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Why is it so hard to name things well in software?</li>
                <li>Why do bad names persist?</li>
                <li>What are some heuristics for assessing how good or bad a name is?</li>
                <li>How has technology hampered efforts to name things well?</li>
                <li>How can technology help our efforts to name things well?</li>
                <li>How can documentarians and developers work together to name things better?</li>
            </ul>
