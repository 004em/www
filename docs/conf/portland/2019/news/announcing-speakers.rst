Speaker Announcement
====================

Happy Wednesday everybody!

We’re less than three months away from Write the Docs Portland 2019
conference! We have so much news to share, so without further adieu,
here we go!

First and foremost, **we’re very excited to announce our finalized speaker
list for the conference!** Our speaker lineup this year is packed with a
diverse and compelling melange of documentarians who have amazing
stories to share with conference attendees. We feel that with our
speakers – whose expertise spans across many fields and industries –
will share interesting and actionable takeaways for attendees.

We want to thank everyone who took time to send us proposals. Each year,
talk selection gets increasingly difficult as we receive a larger,
strong batch of submissions. We had many spirited discussions over weeks
about the speaker lineup, and it is never easy to decide on final list
of speakers. Remember that Write the Docs Portland would not be possible
without your support and proposals. Please consider submitting your
talks to Write the Docs meetup near you, as they are always looking for
more speakers!

With a great speaker lineup just released, now is the time to purchase
your Write the Docs Portland 2019 conference ticket. Act soon, as
tickets tend to sell out weeks before the conference! And while you’re
at the conference, be sure to spend some time exploring the magical city
of Portland.

Finally, our generous sponsors make Write the Docs Portland 2019
conference possible. Interested in having your company as a conference
sponsor? Read on!

Full speaker line-up
--------------------

Every year, we look to bring a diversity of voices to the Write the Docs
main stage. Because the role of "documentarian" is different for each of
us, we strive to craft a lineup that spans a good mix of practical,
philosophical, and technical topics – with a possibility of delightful,
unexpected surprise. We're really excited about the presentations we're
going hear this year – we hope you are too!
