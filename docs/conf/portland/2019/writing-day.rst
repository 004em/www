Make Microsoft Docs More Inclusive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make our Microsoft Docs more inclusive; focusing on underrepresented groups and gender neutrality.

* People to contact: Cory Fowler and Doug Erickson

TensorFlow.org
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TensorFlow.org [https://www.tensorflow.org] is Google's open source machine learning platform and one of the most popular projects on GitHub. The website documentation is the primary way that developers learn about TensorFlow and, many times, their first experience with machine learning and AI.

Technical docs are pulled from GitHub [https://github.com/tensorflow/docs] so you'll need a GitHub account. Markdown experience helps, as well as basic familiarity with Jupyter notebooks [https://jupyter.org/] (since many of the guides [https://www.tensorflow.org/alpha/tutorials/quickstart/beginner] can be run and edited in the browser [https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/r2/tutorials/quickstart/beginner.ipynb] using Colab). API reference docs [http://bit.ly/ml4all-docs-sprint] are built from Python docstrings in the TensorFlow source code [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow].

Read the TensorFlow documentation contributors guide [https://www.tensorflow.org/community/contribute/docs] for workflows and set up. And if you have questions before Writing Day, feel free to ask on the TensorFlow docs mailing list [http://bit.ly/tf-docs-list] or the Gitter channel [https://gitter.im/tensorflow/docs].

Write CockroachDB Docs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CockroachDB is the SQL database for building global, scalable cloud services that survive disasters.. Here’s a quick overview video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgXiMcbGwzQ

Here are a few ways you can contribute to the CockroachDB docs:

**Test our docs**

Give us feedback about clarity, correctness, helpfulness, and ease-of-use by:

- User testing our `Search <https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/issues/4773>`__
- User testing our `Authorization docs <https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/issues/4774>`__

**Improve our current docs**

If you love fiddling around with a new product, you can:

- Improve existing docs by `adding missing details <https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Awtd-writing-day+label%3AT-missing-info>`__ or `correcting errors <https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Awtd-writing-day+label%3AT-incorrect-or-unclear-info>`__
- `Fill gaps <https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+label%3AA-general+label%3Awtd-writing-day>`__ in our existing docs. If you’d like to dig deeper, we’re missing docs on a handful of important features.
- `Make an easy edit <https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Awtd-writing-day+label%3Awtd-easy-first-issue+>`__. This is great for those who want to try Git and open their first PR.

Note: Our docs live in `GitHub <https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs>`__, so you'll need a GitHub account.

...

Feel free to go through the full list of GitHub issues labeled `wtd-writing-day <https://github.com/cockroachdb/docs/labels/wtd-writing-day>`__ and claim the ones you want to work on.
And of course, we (`@laurenh <https://writethedocs.slack.com/?redir=%2Fteam%2FU1B2LRTSQ>`__, `@jseldess <https://writethedocs.slack.com/team/U1B2LRTSQ>`__, and `@rmloveland <https://writethedocs.slack.com/?redir=%2Fteam%2FU1B2LRTSQ>`__) will be available throughout the day to help out.
