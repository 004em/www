Volunteer Registration
======================

Heading to Portland for Write The Docs NA in May? We need your help!

There is plenty to do during the conference and the success of the conference relies on our volunteers. The conference organizers are looking for folks who are willing to help out during the conference. If you volunteer (and are scheduled) for two or more shifts (clocking in at an average of three hours each), you will receive free registration for the conference.
