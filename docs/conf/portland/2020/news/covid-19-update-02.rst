COVID-19 Update 02
==================

Hey Folks,

Since our :doc:`first announcement </conf/portland/2020/news/covid-19-update-01>` last week, we've been following the COVID-19 updates from the Oregon Health Authority and the CDC. We've also seen `King County`_ (Seattle) and `Santa Clara County`_ (SF Bay Area) explicitly request organizations cancel or postpone large gatherings. This has made us come to the conclusion that our event cannot go on as currently scheduled.

**Our current plan of action is to postpone the conference, most likely to a date in August.**

We'll be talking to our venue, staff, speakers, and sponsors to find a date that works. We'd like to keep uncertainty to a minimum, so we hope to announce a firm date by **March 20** at the latest.

Our current plan would be to automatically transfer all existing tickets and sponsorships to the new conference date. We will also refund anyone 100% who can't make the new date work with their schedule.

If you have any questions about this, please reach out to `{{email}} <mailto:{{email}}>`_.

We will continue to provide updates as the conference gets closer. In the meantime, we recommend keeping an eye on the official resources at:

* `CDC Updates <https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html>`_
* `Oregon Health Authority Updates <https://www.oregon.gov/oha/PH/DISEASESCONDITIONS/DISEASESAZ/Pages/emerging-respiratory-infections.aspx>`_
