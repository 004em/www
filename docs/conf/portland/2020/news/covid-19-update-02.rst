COVID-19 Update 02
==================

Hey Folks,

Since our :doc:`first announcement </conf/portland/2020/news/covid-19-update-01>` last week, we've been following the COVID-19 updates from the Oregan Health Authority and the CDC, as well as seeing a number of other organizations cancelling or postponing events due to be held in the next few months, and we've come to the reluctant conclusion that we also need to look into alternatives.

Our current preferred option is to postpone by a few months, most likely to a date in August, and we'll be talking to our venue, speakers, and sponsors, to assess how feasible that is. We'd like to keep uncertainty to a minimum, so if we do decide to take that options we'll aim to announce a firm date within a week.

Other options are a virtual conference, or cancelling the Portland event entirely in 2020, and we don't think that either of these are ideal for Write the Docs.

If you have any questions about this, please reach out to `{{email}} <mailto:{{email}}>`_.

We will continue to provide updates as the conference gets closer. In the meantime, we recommend keeping an eye on the official resources at:

* `CDC Updates <https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html>`_
* `Oregon Health Authority Updates <https://www.oregon.gov/oha/PH/DISEASESCONDITIONS/DISEASESAZ/Pages/emerging-respiratory-infections.aspx>`_
