Write the Docs 2016
===================

Prague, Czech Republic 
September 18-20, 2016


Sponsorships are limited. Since this is a community event, the only purpose of the sponsorship funds is to fund travel expenses for the speakers, fund financial aid, and to provide an amazing educational and fun experience for the attendees. As soon as these needs are met, we will not accept any more sponsorship proposals.

Concept
-------

Writing and maintaining documentation involves a multidisciplinary community of technical writers, designers, typesetters, developers, support teams, marketers and many others. T his group of people can be collectively referred to as “documentarians”.

Write the Docs creates a time and a place for this community to share information, discuss ideas, and work together to improve the art and science of documentation.

For too long, people who care about documentation have felt alone in the world, not able to connect with their community. Write the Docs is a magical experience for many of our attendees, allowing them to feel like they have found their place in the world. We believe this is the most important thing that our event can do, and we aim to provide that experience again this year, and make it better than ever.
