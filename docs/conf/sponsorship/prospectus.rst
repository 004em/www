Concept
==========================

Write the Docs
(`*http://www.writethedocs.org/* <http://www.writethedocs.org/>`__) is a
**two day conference** focusing on documentation systems, tech writing
theory, and information delivery.

Writing and maintaining documentation involves a multidisciplinary
community of technical writers, designers, typesetters, developers,
support teams, marketers and many others. This group of people can be
collectively referred to as “documentarians”.

**Write the Docs** creates a time and a place for this community to
share information, discuss ideas, and work together to improve the art
and science of documentation.

For too long, people who care about documentation have felt alone in the
world, not able to connect with their community. Write the Docs is a
magical experience for many of our attendees, allowing them to feel like
they have found their place. We believe this is the most
important thing that our event can do, and we aim to provide that
experience again this year, and make it better than ever.

Demographics
------------

We hold two conferences yearly, one in Portland, USA in the spring, and one in
Europe, currently Prague, in autumn. Attendence is approximately 400 in the USA
and 300 in Europe, and we expect both conferences to sell out.

Our audience is made up of:

-  Technical Writers (40%)

-  Developers (22%)

-  Support Staff (15%)

-  Managers (12%)

-  Community Contributors, Enthusiasts & Other Folks (11%)
