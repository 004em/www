Write the Docs Sponsorship
==========================

Write the Docs
(`*http://www.writethedocs.org/* <http://www.writethedocs.org/>`__) is a
**two day conference** focusing on documentation systems, tech writing
theory, and information delivery. Our second yearly event was held last
year in Prague, Czech Republic and it was met with rave reviews. We are
excited to hold our **third annual conference** this year!

There will be **250 attendees** from across Europe and overseas.

**Sponsorships are limited**. Since this is a community event, the only
purpose of the sponsorship funds is to fund travel expenses for the
speakers, fund financial aid, and to provide an amazing educational and
fun experience for the attendees. As soon as these needs are met, we
will not accept any more sponsorship proposals.

Concept 
--------

Writing and maintaining documentation involves a multidisciplinary
community of technical writers, designers, typesetters, developers,
support teams, marketers and many others. This group of people can be
collectively referred to as “documentarians”.

**Write the Docs** creates a time and a place for this community to
share information, discuss ideas, and work together to improve the art
and science of documentation.

For too long, people who care about documentation have felt alone in the
world, not able to connect with their community. Write the Docs is a
magical experience for many of our attendees, allowing them to feel like
they have found their place in the world. We believe this is the most
important thing that our event can do, and we aim to provide that
experience again this year, and make it better than ever.

Demographics
------------

Our audience is made up of:

-  Technical Writers (40% in 2015)

-  Developers (22% in 2015)

-  Support Staff (15% in 2015)

-  Managers (12% in 2015)

-  Community Contributors, Enthusiasts & Other Folks (11% in 2015)
