Call for Proposals Reminder
===========================

Hello, fellow documentarians!

The `Write the Docs Cincinnati + Open Help conference <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/cincinnati/2018/>`_ is now a little over two months away, so we hope youâ€™re getting excited for another inimitable Write the Docs experience in beautiful, historic Cincinnati!

`Tickets <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/cincinnati/2018/tickets/>`_ are still available. Our thanks to everyone who has already purchased theirs!

Submit your talk by Monday
--------------------------

Although the deadline is fast approaching, there are still 5 days (including 1 weekend!) left to submit a talk proposal for Write the Docs Cincinnati + Open Help! We'll be accepting proposals until Monday, June 18 at Midnight PST.

If you're interested in pitching a talk, but you need some ideas or guidance, check out our `Call for Proposals <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/cincinnati/2018/cfp/>`_ page. If you've got an idea, but you're having a hard time getting your proposal to come together, you can always ask for feedback on Slack. Your fellow documentarians are there to help!

We can't wait to see your submissions! We'll be reviewing all the talk proposals later this month, and announcing the full conference schedule in mid-July.

More details coming soon
------------------------

We are currently hammering out the last details for this inaugural event. Expect to hear more about volunteer opportunities, the social event, the unconf, and more in the next few weeks.
