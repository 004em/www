Visiting Portland
=================

Wondering where to stay and how to get around once you get into
Portland? The conference will be held at the `Crystal
Ballroom <http://www.mcmenamins.com/CrystalBallroom>`__, in downtown
Portland, and most conference events will be held within just a few
blocks of the Crystal Ballroom.

Eating
------

Portland is an amazing food city. Here are some resources that will help
you find something good to eat:

-  The `Easter
   38 <http://pdx.eater.com/maps/best-portland-restaurants-38>`__ is a
   great resource for delightful food.
-  Willamette Week's `Restaurant
   Guide <http://www.wweek.com/portland/restaurantguide>`__
-  Urban Spoon's `Best of
   Portland <http://www.urbanspoon.com/c/24/Portland-restaurants.html>`__
-  `Food Carts Portland <http://www.foodcartsportland.com/>`__

Where to stay
-------------

We are not working with any of the hotels for attendee accommodations,
but there are many hotels available within walking distance of the
venue:

-  `Crystal Hotel <http://www.mcmenamins.com/CrystalHotel>`__
-  `Ace Hotel <http://www.acehotel.com/portland>`__
-  `Hotel DeLuxe <http://www.hoteldeluxeportland.com/>`__
-  `Mark Spencer <http://www.markspencer.com/>`__
-  `The Sentinel <http://www.sentinelhotel.com/>`__

How to get around
-----------------

Portland is a very accessible city and there are many transportation
options available, public and otherwise.

The MAX
~~~~~~~

The `MAX <http://trimet.org/max>`__ is Portland's major light-rail
system. The MAX primarily connects Portland with the surrounding cities,
such as Gresham, Beaverton, Clackamas, and Hillsboro.

If you're flying into Portland Airport (PDX), we recommend taking the
MAX into downtown Portland. There is a MAX station for the `red
line <http://trimet.org/schedules/maxredline.htm>`__ in the airport
itself.

The venue is along Burnside Street at 14th Ave, just east of the I-405 underpass. Normally the closest Red Line stop to the Crystal Ballroom would be at Galleria SW 10th. However...

Streetcars and Buses
--------------------
Meanwhile there is good news. Portland has a `separate streetcar network <http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/>`__ which criss-crosses the MAX lines. These, along with Portland's extensive `bus network <http://trimet.org/bus/>`__, ought to suffice.

The streetcar loop lines are also under construction, but only through Saturday 14 May. This means their detours will only matter during the day of the hike. They may be your lifeline during the rest of the conference.

The streetcars run along 10th and 11th Avenues. The closest stops to the venue are also on Couch Street. There is also a Whole Foods Market at NW Couch & 12th Ave. See the `Streetcar Loop detour map <http://news.trimet.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/{{cookiecutter.year}}/04/Morrison-Yamhill-MAX-Improvements-Streetcar-Service-Map.png>`__ for details.

Taxi Companies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Portland just got Lyft or Uber, but they are somewhat unreliable. There
are several reliable local taxi companies:

-  `Radio Cab <http://www.radiocab.net/>`__
-  `Broadway Cab <http://www.broadwaycab.com/>`__
-  `Portland Taxi <http://portlandtaxi.net/>`__

Please note that it is *not* common to hail taxis in Portland, and that
your best bet is to call in advance.

Bike Rentals
~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two bike rental companies in downtown Portland that may be
good options if you want to experience Portland by bike (which we very
much recommend!):

-  `Waterfront Bikes <http://www.waterfrontbikes.com/>`__
-  `Cycle Portland <http://www.portlandbicycletours.com/>`__

Visiting Prague
===============

Wondering where to stay and how to get around once you get into Prague?

Traveling to Prague
-------------------

Prague has many direct rail, bus, and flight connections to most major
European cities. In the summer, there are also direct transatlantic
flights to/from New York (JFK) and several other US airports.

Flights
~~~~~~~

Prague's `Vaclav Havel airport <http://www.prg.aero/en/>`__ provides
many direct and low-cost flights with airlines such as Czech Airlines,
Ryanair, Wizz Air, Air Berlin, Norwegian... You get the idea. To get
from the airport to the city center, you can either take a bus (average
journey time 30 minutes, cost ~30czk) or a taxi (average journey time
15-20 minutes depending on traffic, cost ~500aczk).

Trains
~~~~~~

Prague's main train station (Hlavni Nadrazi / hl.n) is a central railway
hub, with direct trains to Germany, Poland, Austria, and Hungary. We
recommend train lines by EuroCity (EC), InterCity (IC) or RailJet (RJ).
You can even take a train from Denmark `inside a
ferry! <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogelfluglinie>`__

To look up train connections, head over to the `ÄŒD
Website <https://www.cd.cz/eshop/default.aspx>`__.

Buses
~~~~~

Prague is a popular destination among backpackers and shoestring
travelers, so there are many affordable bus options if you are traveling
within Europe. The biggest Czech bus company `Student
Agency <http://www.studentagency.eu/>`__ operates direct bus lines
between Prague and cities like Berlin, Vienna, Zagreb, Munich, etc.
Global companies like `Eurolines <http://www.eurolines.com/en/>`__
operate direct lines to many European cities.

How to get around
-----------------

Prague is a very accessible city and there are many transportation
options available, public and otherwise.

Navigating in Prague
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you navigate by smartphone, Google Maps is the most popular method to
calculate routes and travel times. Do exercise caution when calculating
walking routes, as the city center has many gated walkways that are
locked at night.

Trams, buses, and metro
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `Prague Public Transit Co. <http://www.dpp.cz/en/>`__ runs an
extensive network of trams, buses, and 3 metro lines. You can buy a
single ticket, day ticket, or 5-day pass at ticket machines, Trafika
stands (tobacconists) and at the train and bus stations.

If you're flying into Prague Airport (PRG), you can take bus number 100,
119, or the Airport Express (AE) bus. Depending on where you are
staying, these bus lines will connect you to several major metro
stations as well as the main train station. `More information on airport
transfers. <http://www.dpp.cz/en/public-transit-to-prague-airport/>`__

Taxi companies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prague is serviced by **Uber**, and it's the most reliable and cheapest way to secure
direct transportation. You can use your Uber app as you would in any other city
where Uber is available, and you can choose Uber Pop (private cars) or Uber Black
(fancy private cars).

Note: Uber in Czech Republic does not provide tax invoices, only e-receipts. If you
need a tax invoice or prefer to pay in cash, there are several reliable local taxi
companies:

-  `AAA Taxi <http://www.aaataxi.cz/en/>`__
-  `Tick Tack <http://www.ticktack.cz/en>`__
-  `FIX Airport Taxi <http://www.airportcars.cz/?page=o-nas&lang=en>`__

**IMPORTANT: Do not hail/flag taxis in the city center.** As with most major
European cities, taxi scams do occur and can be easily avoided by
calling in advance or using an official taxi stand (these are marked with
a *TAXI* sign and a posted fact sheet in Czech and English).

Where to stay
-------------

Our venue Auto Klub is located across the road from the main train station,
at the edge of the old town district (Prague 1). We recommend booking accommodation
in Prague 1 or Prague 2 area, on the west side of the railway station.

We are not working with any of the hotels for attendee accommodations,
but there are countless hotels and Airbnb apartments available within
walking distance of the venue. Just head over to your favorite booking
site or use one of these sites to research accommodation:

-  `AirBnB <https://www.airbnb.com/>`__
-  `Booking.com <http://www.booking.com/>`__
-  `Hotels.com <http://www.hotels.com/>`__

If you need help or advice when considering a specific hotel or
apartment, send us an email at prague@writethedocs.org and we'll be
happy to help you out.

Where to eat
------------

Prague's culinary culture has made leaps and bounds in recent decades,
and now caters to most if not all dietary requirements and tastes.

The typical Czech cuisine, most commonly found in pub-style restaurants, is a
simple meat-and-potatoes style, similar to the neighboring countries of Germany,
Austria, and Poland. You can find countless Czech pubs within a short walking
distance of the conference venue and all about town.

However, if you are vegetarian, vegan, or prefer a more international selection,
here are a few places that our local Praguer, Mikey Ariel, tried and tested and would
eat again:

-  `Modry Zub <https://goo.gl/maps/a1iguSbwW9o>`_ - Asian-fusion
-  `MAITREA <https://goo.gl/maps/d3GpLZePpuu>`_ - Vegetarian/vegan
-  `La Bodeguita del Medio <https://goo.gl/maps/tw3KSuEWLxC2>`_ - Cuban

Some of these require reservation if you want to dine in a large group.

These are just a few examples, as Prague is packed full of foody options for all budgets,
from sidewalk cafes to fast-food stands, bakeries, and supermarkets. Feel free
to poke Mikey if you have any questions about food in Prague.
