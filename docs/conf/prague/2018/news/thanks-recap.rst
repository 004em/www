Prague conference highlights and thanks to the community!
---------------------------------------------------------

Hello everyone,

As we are wrapping up the Prague conference, we wanted to send out a quick email to thank everyone for helping to make our fifth European conference such a success.
Whether you joined us in person or watched from afar, we thought you might like to get some of the highlights!

Conference recap
================

At over 250 people, this year's conference was our biggest European event to date!
We had the usual mix of main stage and lightning talks, unconference sessions, writing sprints, and social events.
We were also pleased with the success of some new experiments, including livestreaming the talks, running real-time captioning for the main stage, and hosting an in-person job fair.
We received a lot of positive feedback on all of these and are excited to carry them forward to future events.

We also had some interesting feedback on some things we might improve for next time.
The writing day, for example, picked up a lot of interest this year, and we're now looking at providing more in-depth guidance on how to get the most out of the sessions.

Overall, we were so excited to see another conference come together and see our awesome community gather out in the physical world.

Videos, photos, and write-ups
=============================

Videos of all the talks are now available `in our video archive <http://www.writethedocs.org/videos/prague/2018/>`__.
Thanks to `Here to Record <https://heretorecord.com/>`__ for doing such a great job with these.
If you gave a lightning talk, we're working to get them on our site, but in the meantime you can see them on `YouTube <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXmrFoEEf3A&list=PLZAeFn6dfHplRZcYDQjST22bAVeeWML4d>`__ for now.
(You can also subscribe to our `YouTube channel <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr019846MitZUEhc6apDdcQ>`_
so you don't miss any future content!)

We also have photos from the event available on `Flickr <https://www.flickr.com/photos/writethedocs/albums/72157695294209550>`_, thanks to our wonderful photographer `Kay Smoljak <https://twitter.com/goatlady>`_!
We really love the photos each year, and you're welcome to use them for non-commercial purposes, as per our `Creative Commons License <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/>`_.

And finally, several community members have been writing up their experiences at the conference and sharing them in the `wtd-conferences channel on the Write the Docs Slack <https://writethedocs.slack.com/archives/wtd-conferences>`__. If you missed the conference (or are just curious about how your experience compares to others'), check out the discussions there.

Code of Conduct transparency report
===================================

As with any Write the Docs event, this conference was covered by our `community Code of Conduct <http://www.writethedocs.org/code-of-conduct/>`__. 
We aim to be as transparent with CoC incidents and enforcement as we can.
None of our organizers were approached about any CoC concerns at this event.
We know that this is, in part, a reflection of the thoughtful and inclusive community that we're so lucky to have.

That being said, we're also very conscious of the fact that just because nothing was reported doesn't mean nothing happened. If there was any personal conduct or other aspect of the conference experience that did not meet the expectations of behavior set out in the CoC, please email us at `conduct@writethedocs.org <mailto:conduct@writethedocs.org>`_.

Ready for more?
===============

Don't forget we still have our 2nd `Australia conference <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/2018/>`__ in November.
Tickets are still available and the list of talks is now published on their website.

Thanks again
============

We're so grateful to our speakers, sponsors, volunteers, and attendees for making this conference possible.
Whether you were able to join us this time or not, we hope to see you back in Prague next year – or even sooner at one of our other events!
