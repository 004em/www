# About

Join 200 people for a two-day event to explore the art and science of
documentation. You can look forward to learning more about
documentation systems, tech writing theory, information delivery, and
more. Past talks have also covered such diverse topics as typography,
empathy, and [Wabi-sabi][wabisabi].

Write the Docs brings *everyone* who writes the docs together in the same room:
Writers, Developers, Designers, Support Folks.
We all have things to learn from each other, and there's no better way than 
sitting together and talking.

The conference takes place on **August 31 - September 1 (Monday and Tuesday) from
9am to 6pm** in beautiful Prague, Czech Republic. Our venue, [Klub Lavka][klub-lavka],
sits right on the bank of the Vltava river, overlooking the Charles bridge, in the
historical city center of Prague.

We will also hold a meet-and-greet reception on the Sunday before the conference,
as well as a city tour if folks are interested (you can indicate this when you register).
