# About

Join 200 people for a two-day event to explore the art and science of
documentation. You can look forward to learning more about
documentation systems, tech writing theory, information delivery, and
more. Past talks have also covered such diverse topics as typography,
empathy, and [Wabi-sabi][wabisabi].

Write the Docs brings *everyone* who writes the docs together in the same room:
Writers, Developers, Designers, Support Folks. We all have things to learn from each other,
and there's no better way than sitting together and talking.

The conference takes place on **August 31 - September 1 (Monday and Tuesday) from 9am to 6pm** in
beautiful Prague, Czech Republic. Our venue, [Klub Lavka][klub-lavka], sits right on the bank of
the Vltava river, overlooking the Charles bridge, in the historical city center of Prague.

We will also hold a city tour and a meet-and-greet reception on the Sunday before the conference.

## Events

Write the Docs is more than a conference. Each year we organize a wide
bunch of events so that people can get to know each other better.
These events are optional, but we recommend you come into town Saturday
or early Sunday to participate.

This year, those events will include:

#### City tour - Sunday morning

Join us for a walking tour of the old city center around the beautiful and historical
sights that Prague has to offer. The tour is free for attendees but requires registration,
so please indicate on your registration form whether you would like to attend.

We will meet **in front of Club Lavka at 12 NOON**, and end the tour at 3 PM. Please be
on time! The tour will be operated by English-speaking guides from the Prague City Tourism
association, and will include historical and cultural sights around Praha 1, 2, and 5.

After the tour you can continue to the [Prague Ice Cream Festival](https://www.facebook.com/events/911013742295892/) (not included in the conference ticket).

#### Conference Reception - Sunday evening

Come early, get your badge and get to know other attendees.

The reception is hosted by our friends at [Apiary](https://apiary.io/company#contact)
at their lovely new office in [Praha 8](https://goo.gl/maps/L7wCE).

The reception will start at **6 PM** and will include drinks and light snacks. This event
is not included in the friends-and-family ticket.


#### Official Party - Monday night

Wind down and talk about the day's talks in a relaxed and friendly environment.
The party will be held at [The PUB Praha 1][the-pub], 400m from the conference venue.

We will gather from **7 PM**, and you can enjoy free drinks of all varieties, snacks, and sweets.
