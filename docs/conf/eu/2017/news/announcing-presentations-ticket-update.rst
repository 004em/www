Announcing Presentations and Important Ticket Pricing Update
============================================================

We're excited to share with you the lineup for the 2017 Prague conference. This year we received **over 60 proposals**. Needless to say, the selection process was intense, as we had fewer than 20 slots for talks.

The topics this year cover a vast range of subjects, points of view, and real-world case studies. We hope that whatever your role may be, you can find something to relate to.

Following the success of the Portland conference, we also ran a CFP for unconference sessions, so we could have a handful of committed "anchor sessions" to help kick off the unconference.
Of course you can still sign up to run an unconference session during the conference, but we hope that having a few scheduled sessions will help you with your personal schedule planning.

You'll find more info and links to the full talk abstracts down below. You can also visit the `Sessions <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2017/speakers/>`_ page for the full list of presentations.

Important Ticket Pricing Update
-------------------------------

**The short version**: Based on community feedback, we have adjusted our ticket pricing to be more accessible and inclusive to our European community, and refunded the difference to those who already purchased tickets.
You can check out the new ticket pricing on our `Tickets <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2017/tickets/>`_ page.

**The long version**: Each year we examine our ticket pricing structure and determine the different tiers based on factors like production costs, attendee experience, and sponsorship fund offset.
Even though we needed to make adjustments over the years, our goal has always been to maintain a lower price point and therefore a lower entry barrier to our events, so that documentarians from all walks of life can attend.

This year we determined a ticket increase based on many factors, but it turns out that our calculations were simply wrong. There, we said it.
We received some candid feedback from different members of our community who represent the diverse backgrounds and locations of our attendees, and we listened.

Our events are not-for-profit, and even though we do maintain a small (but highly dedicated!) community staff on retainer, the engagement of the documentarians in our community is what keeps the family growing.
We are also, alas, human. Mistakes can and will be made, but standing by a mistake is sometimes more damaging than owning up and fixing it. We can make better mistakes tomorrow.

We hope that the new pricing structure better reflects our core values of accessibility and inclusivity. We are grateful to our fellow documentarians who communicated their feedback gracefully and helped us through this process.
We already processed partial refunds for the price difference for those who already registered, but it might take a few days for the bank or credit card transactions.

See you all in Prague!
