Announcing Presentations and Speakers
=====================================

We’re tremendously excited to share the lineup for Write the Docs Europe 2016 with you. 
It was harder than ever to decide on the final talks this year, and we thank everyone who put 
in the time and effort to submit a proposal. We couldn’t do it without you -- all of you!

In the next few weeks, we'll also be announcing more details of the conference events, including the city 
tour on Saturday, the writing day and welcome reception on Sunday, and the official party on Monday evening.
