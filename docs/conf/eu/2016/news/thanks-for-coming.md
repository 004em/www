Thanks for coming to Write the Docs Europe 2016
===============================================

Hi everyone,

Thanks for attending our third European Write the Docs conference in Prague! We're so grateful to our sponsors, speakers, volunteers, and attendees for making the conference possible. 

We hope you had a wonderful time, and that you are as excited as we are about the beautiful community that is forming. Below we've included all of the resources you might need for staying in touch, like the Write the Docs Slack. We also have a short anonymous survey for you to fill out, so we can make the conference even better next year.

## Tell us how we did

Let us know how we can improve for future conferences and gatherings. We really appreciate your candid feedback!

**Our three question survey is quick and easy, so [go fill it out](TODO).**

## Speak, Sponsor, or help organize next year

This is the end of our 2016 round of conferences,
but that doesn't mean things are over.
We'll be having another North American and European conference next year.

We're always looking for folks who want help us organize the events.
We have worked to document the [roles](TODO) that need to happen to put the conference together.
We could use a few folks who are interested in lending a hand to make the event happen,
so please let us know if that's you!

We depend on sponsors to make our events as magical as they are,
while keeping ticket prices low.
If you are curious about sponsoring Europe or North America next year,
please contact us at [sponsorship@writethedocs.org](mailto:sponsorship@writethedocs.org).

Also don't forget that inspiration and start thinking of your topic ideas for next year.
We'll be opening our North American CFP in December,
and Europe will be open in April next year.

## Write the Docs Slack

The Write the Docs Slack has really taken off this year! Our general Slack channel has been extra busy in the days and weeks leading up to the conference, and we hope that y'all continue the conversations throughout the year. If you haven't joined, head on over and join us! We're at [Write the Docs Slack](http://slack.writethedocs.com/).

## Meetups

We hope you continue to [build the community](http://www.writethedocs.org/meetups/) and keep in touch with other documentarians in your hometown. In this spirit, we have a number of meetups in cities across the country. If you don't see your city [listed](http://www.writethedocs.org/meetups/), consider [starting](http://www.writethedocs.org/meetups/starting/) a meetup! 

Keep us posted if you start one (or encounter a new one) so that we can spread the word.

## Thanks again

The conference is possible only because folks like you make it a great experience.
Thanks for making it another wonderful year.
We hope to see you back again next year,
or even sooner at one of our other events that happen throughout the year.
