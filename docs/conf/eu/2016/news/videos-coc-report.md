Code of Conduct Transparency Report and Videos
==============================================

Now that the dust settled after the conference, we'd like to give another quick
update before we start working on next year's events.

## Code of Conduct Transparency Report

As you know, Write the Docs is an inclusive, friendly, and welcoming community to
all documentarians.
We have published a [report](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2016/news/code-of-conduct-report/) that includes an anonymized list of the violations that we received at this year's event.

This report is anonymized and published for the sake of
maintaining transparency,
and to encourage folks in our community to report incidents
that might disrupt the atmosphere we are passionate about.
Thank you to everyone who reported issues.

## Videos are available!

In case you missed our [October Newsletter](http://www.writethedocs.org/blog/newsletter-october-2016/),
we're happy to present to you all the conference videos from this year, uploaded to
our YouTube channel and organized into a [happy playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZAeFn6dfHpnN8fXXHwPtPY33aLGGhYLJ)!

We'd like to thank again all our speakers and lightning talk presenters for investing
time, effort, and love into their presentations. Each year we see growth in both
the diversity of topics and the spectrum of the roles that are represented in our
conferences, and we hope to keep seeing this in years to come!
