# Schedule

Write the Docs is more than a conference.  Each year we organize a wide range
of events so that people can come together, collaborate, and learn from each
other in different ways.

## Sunday, August 30th

During the day we're hoping to have a walking city tour of Prague, followed by the conference reception in the evening. More information will be announced soon!
