# Schedule

Write the Docs is more than a conference.  Each year we organize a wide range
of events so that people can come together, collaborate, and learn from each
other in different ways.

## Sunday, August 30th

During the day we're hoping to have a walking city tour of Prague, followed by the conference reception in the evening. More information will be announced soon!

## Monday, August 31st - Day 1

This is the main event! Hear from lots of interesting folks about all things documentation.
Check out the [full talk descriptions](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2015/speakers/) for more information.

The talks will take place at the **Klub Lavka, Novotného lávka 201/1, Praha 1**.
