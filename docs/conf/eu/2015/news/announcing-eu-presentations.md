# Announcing Presentations and Speakers

Our talk selection process has just wrapped up and we're eager to announce the presentations for 
this year's conference. Each year we select talks that emphasize intersections between tech writers 
and developers, because we all have so much to learn from each other.

In the next few weeks, we'll be announcing the details for the conference events: 
the city tour and reception on Sunday, the official party on Monday evening, and the closing meetup on
Tuesday evening.

If you haven't purchased your ticket yet, you still have some time! You can
get your tickets [here][tickets].
