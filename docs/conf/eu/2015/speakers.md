      How to Write an Email (and other tips for on-line communication)

Nobody loves email. Nobody really even likes email. In fact email can totally suck and it is here to stay. Despite how we feel about it, we have to deal with email almost every single day. Fortunately we can improve email as a whole by learning how to write email that sucks just a little bit less -- not that you write bad emails.. this talk is for your... friend. Yeah, this talk is for your friends that really need to setup up their email game.

In addition to email this talk will explore some fundamental misunderstandings that people have with modes of online communication and how to correct these misunderstandings. Like how to craft a good Tweet, Facebook Post, and Instant Messaging interaction. 

This is not meant to be a tutorial but rather a conceptual guide for how to think about on-line communication and how to correct some common faults we share as members of the on-line community. The Internet isn't going away anytime soon, and the amount we communicate over it is not going to diminish anytime soon either. This talk attempts to teach one how to make digital communication as painless as possible.

    <h4>IMPOSTER NO MORE: How Tech Writers Can Shed Self-Doubt, Embrace Uncertainty, and Surf the Upcoming Swerve in Technical Documentation</h4>
    <p>
Do you feel like a fraud? Do you have that sneaking fear of being “found out” and exposed? Imposter syndrome is corrosive. It holds us back at work - especially in an industry where we can feel constantly under review by talented peers -  and erodes our happiness. And the subject always comes up whenever technical writers gather; sometimes it feels like the very definition of a technical writer is “One who experiences imposter syndrome.”

Why is this? The first, shorter part of this talk will cover some research and insights into why we, as documentarians, may be especially susceptible to imposter syndrome.

But the field of tech writing is experiencing a swerve: a tipping point - a sea change in direction.  There will always be a demand for ""old"" tech writing, but many of us will have to adapt to this new environment. 

In the second, forward-looking part of this talk, I’ll argue that being an “imposter” has its advantages during such a time of change. The very factors that contribute to our self-doubt are actually the qualities that will enable us to thrive as our role inexorably evolves to take on new, unsolved challenges in engineering information. The keys to our success: apophenia (the ability to see connections between seemingly random collections of information), empathy, and adaptability.

Our future is bright if we pay attention to our new opportunities instead of that nagging voice in our heads.

    <h4><Judas Priest Ate My Scrum Master/h4>
    <p>
Community Management in Free Software communities is still an emerging field and has produced a spectrum of practitioners: from master-manipulators of social media, to those more focused on metrics and data as a means to driving process. Either way, the state of the art is still largely driven by the needs of technical contributors to projects.

Good documentation is a crucial component in a software product and yet often technical writers are overlooked as important stakeholders of the process. Within the community, there are undoubtedly common problems between engineers and technical writers. Software Engineering is full of laws; can we show that these laws apply to technical writers as a means to help bridge the chasm between developers and technical writers??

In this talk Paul walks us through a selection of his favourite laws of software engineering and explores how developers measure them and if technical writers must also obey them. Or not. And what that means for the success of documentation in a Free Software project.

    <h4>Before the docs: writing for user interfaces</h4>
    <p>
Good documentation is important, but it should be your last resort. You need to help users before they reach the docs – in the user interface itself.
 
In this talk, I'll discuss:
-          strategies for writing microcopy when you’re short on space

-          what to explain in the UI, and what to save for the documentation

-          how to pick the right style of embedded help

-          what makes a great error message (and a terrible one)

... with plenty of real-world examples of doing it right and wrong

    <h4>Inclusive Tech Docs - TechComm Meets Accessibility</h4>
    <p>
Presenting a business case for quality documentation can sometimes be a difficult enough task. Adding to that the accessibility requirements, and the whole idea may resemble a mission impossible. The fact that official standards (WCAG and WAI-ARIA) themselves seem to require user manuals in order to be properly implemented, is not helping developers, technical communicators and content managers achieve the desired results. This session will help you navigate through the maze of WCAG techniques, principles, guidelines and success criteria, in order to choose the appropriate path to make the accessibility goals of your techcomm project reality. Get ready to dive into A11y for Tech Docs!

    <h4>MacGyvering your docs</h4>
    <p>
"So, your project needs better docs. For that, you'd need lots of people. Professionalism. A well-thought out plan. All the tools. And a whopping budget in both time and money.

Instead, you're sitting there, with just a few paperclips, seven moldy Mentos mints, a strip of Duct tape, a pencil and some nail polish remover...

Oh, hang on! There's also the combined experiences of generations of people fighting seemingly insurmountable odds. From environmental activists to LGBTQ people taking to the streets, we can draw on a rich history of inspired individuals taking whatever is at hand, mixed with some clever zaniness to quite fabulous effect.

So, what if we apply an activist mindset and some DIY hacking into our process? What lessons can we learn from a world where TOC means Theory Of Change, where working on a shoestring budget is the norm and where empowering people to go beyond what they think they can do is considered mission-critical?

To be clear: the aim here is not to knock professionalism in docs, quite the contrary! Yet, faced with a lack of resources, 'bend the rules and get going' sure beats lethargy.
Not to mention being fun...

(And before you think I'll be bringing back the dreaded mullet: the next MacGyver will be a woman, according to http://thenextmacgyver.com)"

    <h4>Generating docs from APIs</h4>
    <p>
      APIs define contracts between a service and a client, and with the rise of representation languages like Swagger, Apiary, and RAML, these contracts can be consumed programmatically and adapted easily into our codebases. Other tools like JSON Schema also contribute to this idea of integration between service and client.

But what about our documentation? If API contracts can be assimilated into software, surely it can drive our documentation too? In this talk, I want to introduce some of the techniques I've used on past projects that allow exactly that. By using remote schemas to generate software, it also allows us to generate working documentation that is always relevant and never out of date. Apart from accuracy, we also get the added benefits of reduced development time, reduced effort, and reduced duplication. We can all of this by documenting once, and re-using across multiple projects!

    <h4>Whatchamacallit: Controlled Vocabularies for Technical Writers</h4>
    <p>
      A few years ago, I started working for a software company as their first de facto technical writer. It had a powerful, but complex product. The task was daunting, especially since whoever I talked to seemed to describe an entirely different product. I struggled to put the puzzle pieces together into a coherent whole.  

Just like me, users have to form a mental model of every new, unfamiliar software product. Good user interfaces go a long way towards this, but for complex products, UI is not enough. Developers do have a mental model of the product they work on, but it can be very different from that of people on the marketing side. 

After several years of experience in information management, one of the first things I did was to build a controlled vocabulary about the software product I had to document. It was invaluable in a number of ways I did not expect at the beginning: to categorize and filter help content, for the self-help site's navigation, as a glossary, as documentation plan, as a features overview, as a structure for test cases, etc.

Technical writers play an important role in bringing users, developers and business stakeholders on the same page. They hold the key to product-specific terminology. In this talk, I will show you how to make full use of that power through controlled vocabularies. I will share tools to create and maintain various types of vocabularies, and explain what each type is useful for. You can start with a simple list of terms and expand it into a glossary, a thesaurus, a taxonomy, or even a full-fledge ontology, according to your needs.

In my case, it wasn't long until other people in the company started using the controlled vocabulary for their own purposes. This artefact also induced debates on several key concepts in the software, which in turn influenced product development.

I am now building a start-up in the technical communication domain, for which I am conducting more research into controlled vocabularies, and ontologies in particular.

    <h4>Visual Documentation Language</h4>
    <p>
    A picture says more than …how many lines of code?

Firstly this talk offers an introduction to a variety of established as well as experimental visual documentation methods. Subsequently, it explores the question whether or not these approaches can be applied to software documentation in a reasonable way.
in this regard it takes a closer look at individual methods and estimates their corresponding affordances in terms of time, skill, resources and potential automatization.
Eventually, this talk presents an initial attempt to translate existing docs into visual languages and discusses the according outcomes.

Primarily, the objective of reading and writing the docs serves the purpose to convey clear, unambiguous information, at the same time, the experience should be as engaging and pleasant as possible. Building a Visual Documentation Language serves to reach this goal.

    <h4>Gardening Open Docs</h4>
    <p>
    With about 1000 different editors each month, the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) documentation Web site for Open Web technologies is a trafficked wiki with edits of all kind of quality: perfect text from seasoned professional writers to rough notes by teen-aged technology learners.

In this talk, we are going to explore how to keep this doc garden clean, how the diversity of editors influence its evolution, and how we find our way through treacherous jungles to well-maintained royal gardens. 

This is about improving quality, working with diverse communities, fostering innovation, and carnivorous plants.
