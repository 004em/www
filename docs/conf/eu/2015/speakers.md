    <h4>Tested and Correct, How to Make Sure Your Documentation Keeps Working</h4>
    <p>Wnen you are writing documentation for software, a top priority is surely that what you write is correct. That is, the examples you provide give the output you say they will. Or perhaps it is that the links in your documentation link to an expected page. Usually this is done with manual testing at the time of writing. Your organisation may have practices in place to make sure that these examples don't get too out of date - maybe someone checks them periodically, maybe code review comes with comments like "I remember that this part of the code is used in an example on Page 37 of our docs, change it". But these methods are tedious and flawed. This talk will give examples from my work as a software engineer in creating tested snippets for documentation which are linked to the code they represent. It will show how using techniques traditionally reserved for software testing can ease the burden of keeping documentation up to date.

    <h4>The quest for scientific credit for software documentation</h4>
    <p>Modern geoscientific research relies heavily on numerical computations involving complex software developed by physicists or chemists. It would seem that scientists should be well versed in ways of documenting and explaining their research. Yet, when it comes to the documentation of scientific software projects, one soon realises that scientific wisdom is spread mostly by LaTex and that the word 'documentation' starts to mean something completely different.
</p>
<p>Writing a documentation for a scientific project can be quite challenging. There are not that many examples of well-documented open-source geoscientific numerical modelling software projects to drew the inspiration from. Even though the scientific results should be reproducible, mechanisms that reward those who deliver well documented software are still to become widespread. The scientists are judged basing on the number of peer-reviewed  papers they publish, therefore investing the time solely to offer the documentation is difficult. The documentation should include the actual mathematical equations and theory behind the software, figures documenting the scientific results as well as code listings and usage examples. The target audience may have a strong background in science, computer science, both or neither.
</p>
<p>I'm a PhD student at the Faculty of Physics working in a research group developing two C++ libraries aimed at the atmospheric community. In this presentation I'd like to talk about our quest to link the scientific credit with the software documentation. I'd like to talk about how we tried to combine explaining scientific ideas in LaTex with explaining API along with automatic code listings in one journal-structured documentation and how we managed to publish both the code and the documentation in public, peer-reviewed Geoscientific Model Development journal.

    <h4>Documenting your Story - Crafting a good presentation</h4>
    <p>Whilst not a part of the core documentation of projects, presentations and delivering them to the public are an essential part of spreading the word about what you do.
</p>
<p>They need to be as equally consistent with your messaging and style guides, get to a key point effectively and also allow the presenter to inject some personality.
</p>
<p>This is especially hard with technical projects where the 'story' is either hard to explain or can't just end up sounding like a sales pitch.
</p>
<p>In this presentation I will explore and explain my experiences as an advocate for several open source projects, audience reactions to those presentations and how I have iterated my presentations in sync with changes to product and branding.

    <h4>All roads might not lead to docs</h4>
    <p>Documentation may not have a reputation as a creative enterprise, but we know that filling the role of documentarian often requires creative problem solving - especially in figuring how to create, display, and maintain a reliable collection of docs.
</p>
<p>If your goal is clear - we need (better) docs - then the creativity comes in discovering how to get there. But creative problem solving has an important role to play in determining whether you've got the right goal: are docs the answer?
</p>
<p>This talk starts with framing the common types of needs that docs can meet: informing, learning, referencing, persuading, and engaging. With examples for each, we'll see how creative thinking - mixed with data and some knowledge of human behavior - can shape problem statements that lead to better solutions (which aren't always docs). It's about making sure that docs are the right goal so that we, as documentarians, aren't just writing - we're shaping the discussion about when and how docs make our teams, organizations, and communities better.</p>

    <h4>Screencasting 101</h4>
    <p>As a writer, it's been tough for me to admit that not everyone wants to read my carefully written documentation. While people will read, not everyone learns by reading the docs. Since my goal is to make sure my documentation can meet as many learning styles as possible, that has meant spreading my documentarian wings and bridging out from only writing the docs into recording them as well.
</p>
<p>Part of my documentation journey has been learning how to create screencasts and I want to share that knowledge with everyone. From picking the right topics, to outlining, to writing a script (yes I promise, there is still writing involved), to how to record your audio and video, I'll cover it all. You don't need to be a professional voice actor or videographer to create a screencast, even a writer can create something wonderful.

    <h4>Back to the Future: What Can Documentarians Learn From The Past?</h4>
    <p>“Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it." (George Santayana)
</p>
<p>“I've got news for Mr. Santayana: we're doomed to repeat the past no matter what. That's what it is to be alive.” (Kurt Vonnegut)
</p>
<p>Programmers and documentarians alike tend to emphasize the new and the innovative, over against the old, the traditional, the past. The pace of change in software development requires this perspective. But it can also lead us to disregard what the past can teach about how to move forward, to innovate, to create the change that we are all part of. We can keep the best of tradition, and still innovate. The proposed talk will look at some examples from the past and present of software documentation, and offer suggestions for how to use both to imagine the future.
</p>
<ul><li>In 1978, Microsoft’s early team of 13 included a technical writer. Nine engineers, one technical writer! How did this kind of attitude develop, and how and why have we lost it? Do we need it back? Here are some teaser “lessons from the past;” I’ll also develop them into thoughts about the future.
</li>
<li>The STC wasn’t always a stuffy walled garden. In some ways, Write The Docs has simply supplanted it as a resource for writers. (I want to talk about Techwhirl here too, but haven’t quite worked out how yet.)
</li>
<li>Techcomm programs emerged as early as the 1960s -- right at the same time that computer science programs were being established. The University of Washington techcomm program started as an effort to teach engineers how to write docs -- the same approach that many companies are moving to today.
</li>
<li>Once upon a time, XML was an exciting new *lightweight* spec to help with web publishing. (Compared to its parent, SGML, it is lighter!) Newer markup languages are continuing in the same spirit. Asciidoc in particular, with its support for DocBook, acknowledges this continuity.
</li>
<li>The STC is dwindling, many doc efforts are led by people who have no formal training in techcomm, and XML for doc publishing is a hidebound tool associated with corporate types. But viewed in historical context, all three represent important contributions to the development of software documentation that we care about today. 
</li></ul>
<p>Different contexts, today as always, require different approaches. But if one distinguishing characteristic of Write The Docs is that it brings engineers and writers together to truly communicate about the docs, let’s keep the door open for communication across technologies and approaches to documentation too. One way to keep this open mind is to appreciate what we have in common with the efforts that have come before us.
</p>
<p>This proposal was inspired by the WTD forum topic “Traditional tech writing, new tech writing,” which emerged out of a Twitter conversation toward the end of WTD NA. It might work nicely in tandem with Riona’s about “the swerve” (she and I have chatted about our ideas). You might say that while we both want to talk about how the worlds of software documentation are changing, she wants to emphasize break, or shift, whereas I want to emphasize continuity.

    <h4>i18what?</h4>
    <p>Having your documentation available in multiple languages is important to reach as many users as possible. Especially tutorials and documentation for beginners is better received if it's written in the reader's native language. But how to translate the documentation easy and fast? Software development must also deal with the translation of text and has developed a technique called "internationalization", which is abbreviated as "i18n". It separates the source code and the text strings so that the text strings can be translated easily. And a similar approach can be used to translate documentation.
</p>
<p>But how to organize and manage a documentation in multiple languages? How to keep the different translations up-to-date without ending up with different versions of your documentation? This talk will explain a basic work flow to internationalize your documentation project. It will address common problems that arise when internationalization is used and how to avoid them.

    <h4>Free Your Mind and Your Docs Will Follow</h4>
    <p>As documentarians, we face plenty of hurdles to delivering what we are assigned (harried and inaccessible subject matter experts, barely functioning builds, sketchy doc infrastructure, etc.). But there are also the obstacles that keep us from writing the docs we *want*, and those are largely ingrained in our companies' processes and our own heads. 
</p>
<p>We pay lip service to "the user" but then subordinate that to concerns of structure, consistency, and stylistic conventions. The result is often docs that are internally consistent and satisfy the editorial,  translation, and production teams for their economy and re-usability but are so dry and product-centered that they fail to connect with the most important audience - actual human beings. 
</p>
In this presentation, I'll talk about ways to overcome burdensome organizational processes and our own timidity to create room for the inspiration and creativity needed to bring the docs' subject alive.
