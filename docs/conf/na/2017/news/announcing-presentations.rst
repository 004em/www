Announcing Presentations and Speakers
=====================================

We're excited to share with you the lineup for the 2017 Portland conference. This year we received **over 100 proposals**. Needless to say, the selection process was intense, as we had fewer than 20 slots for talks.

The topics this year have a vast range of subjects, points of view, and real-world case-studies, and we hope that whatever your role may be, you can find something to relate to.

This year we are also trying something new, and we had a CFP for unconference sessions, so this list includes both main track talks and unconference sessions.

Of course you can still sign up to run an unconference session during the conference, but we hope that having a few scheduled sessions will help you with your personal schedule planning.
