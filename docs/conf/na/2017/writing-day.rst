Documenting a new project?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Check out our `beginners guide <http://docs.writethedocs.org/writing/beginners-guide-to-docs/>`_ to writing documentation.
This should help you get started,
and give you some ideas for how you can contribute to a project that you love.

Write Write the Docs on Writing Day
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This year we're also running a session where you can help improve your favourite website. Yup, you can brainstorm improvements, write helpful content or just magically improve `Write the Docs <http://www.writethedocs.org>`_.

Ideally you'll already be familiar with GitHub and writing in plain text (markdown or restructured text), but we'll be there to help out if you're not. And we have things to do if you'd rather write in Google Docs or program in python or jinja as well.

Here are a few suggestions of things you might want to do on the writing day.

Brainstorm User Oriented Architechture
=======================================

Site is very content type based â€“ find ways to introduce user-oriented labels considering audience. Who is coming to the site, why? What are the goals of the site?

- Learn about docs
- Get involved with the community
- Attend conference
- Submit a conference proposal
- Find a video of a talk that I saw

Improve Navigation
===================

we don't expect you to shake up the content itself, but maybe you can suggest or implement a new navigation system.

Write for the Newsletter
=========================

Summarise content from the slack channel for the newsletter.

.. TODO:: list of topics

Write for Documentation Guide
==============================

Expand a section, a page or more, from the :doc:`/guide/index/`. Or find some images that add to the walls of text.

Fix Website Issues
===================

We'll have a list of issues on GitHub tagged as `writingday` that include things like

- fix broken links (we have a lot of these)
- improve the meetup pages
- implement a video archive
- add list of conference write ups
