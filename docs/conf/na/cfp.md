## Write the Docs NA 2015 Call for Proposals

We here at Write the Docs are accepting proposals for our 2015
conference, which is happening **May 17-19, 2015** in Portland, Oregon.

The deadline for submitting your proposal is **11:59 PM PST on March
1**.

## Conference Goals

Write the Docs is an event for anyone who cares about documentation and
wants to gather and learn from like-minded people no matter their
personal or professional background. Whether you're a tech writer,
programmer, designer, support technician, or something else entirely,
come and share your tips, tricks, experiences, ideas, frustrations,
hopes, and anything else that your passion for documentation inspires
you to bring to the table.

Come be a part of this fantastic multi-disciplinary gathering of
documentation artisans.

## Topic Ideas

Although the general focus of Write the Docs is on documentation,
there's a strong emphasis on the software industry. Within that thematic
scope, we love having wide-ranging content that will stretch people in
new directions.

Some of our favorite talks are ones that make people see the world in a
new way. Teaching someone something they already knew about is great;
showing someone something they didn't know existed is magical.

We love talks that deliver hard-earned knowledge based on real-world
experience and research. Whether it's a story about spreading the
documentarian gospel in your company or tips and tricks for writing that
you've learned, come share it with people who are eager to know.

We believe that tech writing and documentation don't always get the
respect and consideration they deserve. So come share with us how you
convinced your company why documentation should be an organizational
priority

Below are some talks from past events that we feel really captured the

## Presentation formats

Presentations will be either 20 or 40 minutes long. Pick the format that
best fits the scope and style of your presentation. In general, however,
we do recommend 20-minute talks.

## Speaker Benefits and Logistics

If you are selected to speak at Write the Docs, we will waive your
attendance fee. We regret that we are not able to cover the cost of
travel or lodging for speakers at this time. By not covering travel
costs for our speakers, we are able to keep ticket prices low and to
make the conference accessible to the largest number of participants
possible. If your proposal is accepted but you are unable to attend due
to travel costs, however, please let us know and we will do what we can
to help out.

Speaking at Write the Docs is a fantastic way to participate in the
conference. Additionally, all those who submit a proposal but are not
selected to speak will be able to register at the early bird
registration price.

Proposal decisions will be sent by the middle of March.
