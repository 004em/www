## Write the Docs NA 2015 Call for Proposals

Write the Docs is accepting proposals for our 2015 conference, happening **May 17-19, 2015** in Portland, Oregon.

The deadline for submitting your proposal is **11:59 PM PST on March 1**.

## Conference Goals

Write the Docs is a place where everyone who cares about documentation can gather and learn from each other. Attendees at the event range in professional and personal interests across a spectrum of tech writers, programmers, designers, support teams, marketers, and more. 

Come be part of the schedule at this fantastic multi-disciplinary gathering of documentation artisans. 

## Topic ideas

We focus on documentation, with a slant towards the software industry. We love having wide-ranging content that will stretch people in new directions.

Some of our favorite talks are ones that make people see the world in a new way. Teaching someone something they already knew about is great, but teaching someone something they didn't know existed is magical.

We love talks that deliver hard-earned knowledge based on real-world experience and research. Whether that is a story about spreading the documentarian gospel to make your companies docs amazing, or tips and tricks for writing that you've learned, come share it.

We believe that tech writing and documentation don't always get the respect they deserve. We love talks about how to make documentation amazing, and how you convinced your company why that was important. 

Some talks from past years that we really liked and felt captured the spirit of our event include:

* Daniya Kamran - Translating Science into Poetry ([abstract](http://docs.writethedocs.org/conference/talks/#daniya-kamran-translating-science-into-poetry))
* Kevin Hale - Getting Developers and Engineers to Write the Docs ([abstract](http://docs.writethedocs.org/conference/talks/#kevin-hale-getting-developers-and-engineers-to-write-the-docs))
* Matthew Butterick - Typography for Docs ([abstract](http://docs.writethedocs.org/conference/talks/#matthew-butterick-typography-for-docs))
* Kenneth Reitz - Documentation at Scale ([abstract](http://docs.writethedocs.org/2014/na/talks/#kenneth-reitz-documentation-at-scale))
* Heidi Waterhouse - The New Sheriff in Town: Bringing documentation out of chaos ([abstact](http://docs.writethedocs.org/2014/na/talks/#heidi-waterhouse-the-new-sheriff-in-town-bringing-documentation-out-of-chaos))

## Presentation formats

Presentations will be either 20 or 40 minutes long. Pick the format that best fits the scope and style of your presentation, however we generally recommend 20 minute talks.

## Speaker Benefits and Logistics

If you are selected to speak at Write the Docs, we will waive your attendance fee. We regret that we are not able to cover the cost of travel or lodging for speakers at this time. By not covering travel costs for our speakers, we are able to keep ticket prices low and make the conference accessible to the largest number of participants possible. However, if your proposal is accepted but you are unable to come due to travel costs, please let us know and we will do what we can to help out.

Speaking at Write the Docs is a fantastic way to participate in the conference. Additionally, all those who submit a proposal but are not selected to speak will be able to register at the early bird registration price.

Proposal decisions will be sent by the middle of March.
