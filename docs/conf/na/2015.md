# 2015 - North America

**Write the Docs** is a two-day conference focused on documentation systems,
tech writing theory, and information delivery.

Writing and maintaining documentation involves the talents of a
multidisciplinary community of technical writers, designers, typesetters,
developers, support teams, marketers, and many others.

This conference creates a time and a place for this community of documentarians
to share information, discuss ideas, and work together to improve the art and
science of documentation.

We invite all those who write the docs to spread the word:

> Docs or it didn't happen!

## Venue

We will taking over the [Crystal Ballroom][crystal-ballroom] again this year.
It is a beautiful concert venue located [in the middle of downtown][downtown-map]

Our Hallway Track will be held in [Lola's Room][lolas-room], and will be

The building also has a couple of other areas where you can have a conversation

Weiden+Kennedy.
On Sunday, Mozilla will be sponsoring a documentation sprint focusing on
