# About

Join us for a three-day event to explore the art and science of
documentation. You can look forward to learning more about
documentation systems, tech writing theory, information delivery, and
more. Past talks have also covered such diverse topics as typography,
empathy, and [Wabi-sabi][wabisabi].

The main event takes place from **May 18-19 (Monday and Tuesday) from
9am to 6pm**.  We will return to the historic [Crystal
Ballroom][crystal-ballroom], [centrally
located](http://goo.gl/maps/D2WrJ) in the heart of Portland.

#### Keynote: We Are All Abbott and Costello

Documentarians and technical writers have seen many changes in our professions
in recent years, and there’s no sign of change slowing down. One thing endures:
the writer's goal of communicating to understanding. It’s not as easy as it
sounds. Because we are all Abbott and Costello.

#### Keynote: The Federated Wiki

Just as the first wiki changed how people write, our new wiki will change how
people work. By pushing steadily on two fundamental ideas, refactoring to ease
improvement and federation to ease sharing, we have once again uncovered a
simpler and more powerful internet.

## Events

Write the Docs is more than a conference. Each year we organize a wide
bunch of events so that people can get to know each other better. This
year we're expanding those activities into a full third day of fun.
These events are optional, but we recommend you come into town Saturday
or early Sunday to participate.

This year, those events will include:

#### Hike - Saturday afternoon

Enjoy the majestic beauty of Portland with this walk in the woods.

#### Writing Day - Sunday, all day

Get together and *write the docs* with your fellow documentarians. This
is a great opportunity to learn from others and share your knowledge.
Document your own projects, or contribute to an open-source project such
as Wordpress or Mozilla Developer Network.

This event is sponsored by the fine documentarians at the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/).

#### Conference Reception - Sunday night

Come early, get your badge and get to know other attendees.

#### Official Party - Monday night

Wind down and talk about the days talks in a relaxed and friendly
environment.
