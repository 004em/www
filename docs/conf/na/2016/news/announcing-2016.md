# Date Announcement for NA 2016

Hello, good people of the Write The Docs community! We are delighted to announce that we’ve locked in dates for our next conference. 

**Write the Docs North America will return to Portland, Oregon, from May 22-24, 2016.**

We’ll be back at the Crystal Ballroom with an awesome lineup of documentation talks, along with the promise of friendly debate and lively discourse. Read on for more details on the conference, as well as the exciting supplemental activities leading up to the main event.

## The Conference
If you’ve been to Write The Docs before, you know that you’re in for three of most thought-provoking and inspirational days of your professional year. And if you haven’t been yet, join us! We’d hate for you to miss out!

Every year we assemble a group of exceptional speakers to discuss the art and science of documentation. You’ll learn about the latest in documentation tools, tech writing theory, content delivery, and more. In the past, we’ve had talks on topics ranging from poetry to continuous deployment, from typography to API reviews. 

After an opening reception on Sunday, May 22, the main event will take place May 23 & 24 (Monday and Tuesday) from 9am to 6pm. We will return to the historic [Crystal Ballroom](http://writethedocs.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=94377ea46d8b176a11a325d03&id=225681cc09&e=83378cbc40), [centrally located](http://writethedocs.us6.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=94377ea46d8b176a11a325d03&id=a6f70a1d2f&e=83378cbc40) in the heart of Portland. 

In addition to the conference itself, we have a host of auxiliary events to round out your Write The Docs experience. 

## Auxiliary events
Write the Docs is so much more than a conference—it’s a rare and golden opportunity for documentarians to interact with our community in-person. Every year we organize a handful of side events to augment the main conference, making it easier for attendees to get to know each other. 

All of these events are optional, but we’d strongly recommend you come into town Saturday or early Sunday so you can participate.

This year, our auxiliary events will include:

- **Hike** (Saturday Afternoon) --- Join us for what’s become a Write The Docs institution: A trek along the verdant trails of Portland’s stunning Forest Park.
- **Writing Day** (Sunday Daytime) --- Kicking things off the day before the conference, our Writing Day is all about, y’know, writing the docs! Meet up with your fellow documentarians either to collaborate on your own projects or contribute to open source projects like [Wordpress](http://writethedocs.us6.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=94377ea46d8b176a11a325d03&id=6355548576&e=83378cbc40) or the [Mozilla Developer Network](http://writethedocs.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=94377ea46d8b176a11a325d03&id=8b0eab8076&e=83378cbc40). This is an awesome opportunity to share your knowledge and learn from your peers. 
- **Conference Reception** (Sunday Night) --- Come early, pick up your badge, and get to know other attendees.
- **Official Party** (Monday Night) --- Wind down and discuss the first day's talks in a relaxed and friendly environment.
- **Something new and exciting** --- We have a couple more tricks up our sleeves for this year. Stay tuned :)
