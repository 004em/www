Announcing Ticket Sales and Call for Proposals
==============================================

The conference is four months away and we hope you're getting excited!
It will be another wonderful year full of great conversation and
wonderful talks.

Today we are announcing our Call for Proposals and ticket sales.
Speaking at Write the Docs is a fantastic way to share your ideas with
our wonderful community of documentarians. 
If there is something you'd really like to see a talk on this year,
submit a talk on it,
or refer someone else who would be good!

Tickets
-------

We believe that everyone who cares about this topic has a place at our
event. We keep ticket prices low so that it is accessible to the widest
range of people possible.

This year, our ticket prices will ensure that the absolute cost of the
conference is covered, with revenue from sponsorships used to extend the
conference and make it substantially more awesome.

If you can't afford these prices and still wish to attend, please email
us at conf@writethedocs.org, and we can work on getting you reduced
price tickets.

Call for Proposals
------------------

Although the general focus of Write the Docs is on documentation,
there's a strong emphasis on the software industry. Within that thematic
scope, we love having wide-ranging content that will stretch people in
new directions.

Some of our favorite talks are ones that make people see the world in a
new way. Teaching entirely new ideas to others can be magical, and we
are always delighted with the breadth of knowledge that our community
brings together.

We love talks that deliver hard-earned knowledge based on real-world
experience and research. Whether it's a story about spreading the
documentarian gospel in your company or tips and tricks for writing that
you've learned, come share it with people who are eager to know.

We believe that tech writing and documentation don't always get the
respect and consideration they deserve. Come share the problems with
documentation your company overcame, or how you ensure documentation is
an organizational priority.

You can read our full `Call for
Proposals <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2016/cfp/>`__ on the website.

Conclusion
----------

We hope you will join us at Write the Docs again this year. Whether as a
speaker or attendee, you can bet it will be another delightful year.
