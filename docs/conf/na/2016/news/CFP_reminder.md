## Call for Proposals Reminder, Initial Sponsors Announced

The conference is now just a little more than three months away, so we 
hope you're getting ready for the latest installment of the amazing 
Write the Docs in lovely Portland, Oregon!

Early Bird tickets are sold out. Thanks to everyone who has already
purchased a ticket. We do expect the conference to sell out fully, so
[get your tickets now](https://ti.to/writethedocs/write-the-docs-na-2015/).

## Call for Proposals

There is still time to submit your talk to Write the Docs!  The [Call
for Proposals](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/cfp/) is open until 
**February 29th at Midnight PST** -- remember? You've got a whole extra day 
this year! So make sure to get your talk in this month.

Remember, too -- on the [Call for Proposals page]
(http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2016/cfp/), we've got some tips and examples 
to help inspire you. And if you're got an idea, but you're not sure what to do with 
it, ask on the Slack channel. Your fellow documentarians will be happy to help!

Our inimitable meetup leader, Mike Jang, is also hosting a local and remote
meetup on February 25 for anyone who'd like to get feedback, attempt a dry run, 
or check out what your fellow documentarians are thinking about presenting.

(thought: add more references? this page is kinda nice:
http://weareallaweso.me/for_speakers/how-to-write-a-compelling-proposal.html
not least because it's got a nice-looking list of links to related resources)

We will be announcing the conference program on **March 18th**.
