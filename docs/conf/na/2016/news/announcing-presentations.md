# Announcing Presentations and Speakers

It’s here! We’ve finally made all the painful choices about 
who’s speaking at Write The Docs NA 2016, 
and we’re tremendously excited to share it with you. 
It was harder than ever to decide on the final talks this year, 
and we thank everyone who took the time and thought to submit a proposal. 
We couldn’t do it without you -- all of you! The definition of “documentarian” 
just keeps expanding. We’re now not only developers and tech writers, 
we’re customer support staff, product managers, testers, and designers, 
working alone or on big teams, on open source projects 
or on proprietary enterprise software. 
We’re all the people who care about making better docs.

So here’s the list of talks. We’ll be finalizing the schedule soon, and we’ll let you
know when it's published.

In the next few weeks, we'll also be announcing more details of the
conference events: the annual hike on Saturday, the writing 
day and reception on Sunday, and the official party on
Monday evening.
