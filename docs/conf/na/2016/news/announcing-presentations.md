# Announcing Presentations and Speakers

It’s here! We have chosen the line up for Write the Docs NA 2016
and we’re tremendously excited to share it with you. 
It was harder than ever to decide on the final talks this year, 
and we thank everyone who took the time and thought to submit a proposal. 
We couldn’t do it without you -- all of you! The definition of “documentarian” 
just keeps expanding. We’re now not only developers and tech writers, 
we’re customer support staff, product managers, testers, and designers, 
working alone or on big teams, on open source projects 
or on proprietary enterprise software. 
We’re all the people who care about making better docs.

## Presentations (and a Panel!)

**So here it is, the [list of talks][talks]!**
We hope there's something there for everyone to enjoy,
and also to stretch your views a little bit, as well :)
We're trying a couple of new things this year,
including a *Panel* and *Thunderstorm Talks*.

We had a number of interesting presentations about companies transforming their documentation process.
Instead of choosing just one,
we asked the speakers to join us on a panel,
so that folks can compare the different approaches.

We are also sad every year that we have only 18 speaking slots at the event.
This year we added Thunderstorm Talks to give us a few more opportunities.
These talks break a few of the 30 minute slots into two 15-minute talks.
They'll break up the pace of the day,
and will let people get some new ideas across in an action packed format.

## Reminders and Resources

In the next few weeks, we'll also be announcing more details of the
conference events: the annual hike on Saturday afternoon, the writing 
day and reception on Sunday, and the official party on
Monday evening. 

If you haven't purchased your ticket yet, time hasn't quite run out. 
You can pick up your tickets [here][tickets]. 
**We are already 75% sold out**,
and expect to sell out before the end of April,
so don't wait to get your tickets!

## Poll the Docs

We've also got a documentarian [questionnaire][survey] for you! Kata and the folks at [Provonix][provonix] have been 
working to put together a survey that can help our growing community understand better all the 
different ways we do our work, where the current challenges lie, and what the future holds.

It would be great if you could set aside 10 minutes from your busy days to [fill it out][survey].
We'll be sharing the results with everyone, so your contributions will help the community as a whole understand itself better.
Think of it like therapy,
except at the end we get a better conference,
better tools,
and the uncanny feeling that maybe we aren't alone in this crazy universe of ours.

## Write The Docs EU 2016

The event last year in Prague so much fun,
we've decided to hold our European conference there again this year.
Come talk docs with us again in **Prague, Czech Republic, September 18-20**.

It will be another great event in a magnificent European city.
We'll be announcing more details in the coming months,
but you can put it in your calendar now.
