# Announcing Presentations and Speakers

It’s here! We’ve finally made all the painful choices about 
who’s speaking at Write The Docs NA 2016, 
and we’re tremendously excited to share it with you. 
It was harder than ever to decide on the final talks this year, 
and we thank everyone who took the time and thought to submit a proposal. 
We couldn’t do it without you -- all of you! The definition of “documentarian” 
just keeps expanding. We’re now not only developers and tech writers, 
we’re customer support staff, product managers, testers, and designers, 
working alone or on big teams, on open source projects 
or on proprietary enterprise software. 
We’re all the people who care about making better docs.

So here it is, the [list of talks][talks]. We’ll be finalizing the schedule soon, 
and we’ll let you know when it's published.

## Sponsors

Sponsorship is one of the reasons we can create such a great 
conference each year. We're happy to have the following additional sponsors join us
in supporting the Write the Docs community:

 * [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
 * [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/)

## Poll the Docs

We've got a documentarian questionnaire for you! Kata and the folks at Provonix have been 
working to put together a survey that can help our growing community understand better all the 
different ways we do our work, where the current challenges lie, and what the future holds.

We'll be sharing the results with everyone, so your contributions will help you and all of us.
