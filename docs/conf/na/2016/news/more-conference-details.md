More Conference Details
=======================

Write the Docs just about four weeks away now! We hope you are all as excited as we

If you can't make it to this year's conference in Portland, don't fret. We've just announced 
our [European conference][eu-conf], taking place this year again in glorious Prague September 18-20! 
Tickets are now on sale, and the call for papers is open

We're putting the finishing touches on the Portland conference, so this email
contains more information for you about this year's conference events. We've added some cool
resources, and we hope you'll take advantage of them. We also hope you'll be able to join most 
if not all of the events outside the main conference talks, because they're some of our 
favorite things.

Saturday - Annual Hike
----------------------

If you're in town Saturday afternoon, please join us for 
our [annual hike to Pittock Mansion][hike]. We've had rain every year, but that 
doesn't stop us from hoping for sun every year, too!

(QUESTION: no tickets required this year?)

Sunday - Writing Day and Conference Reception
---------------------------------------------

During the day on Sunday, we'll have our [Writing Day][writing-day]
, followed by the reception in the evening.

Both of these events on Sunday are at CENTRL Office, located
at 1355 NW Everett St ([map][centrl-map]). Head there at any point during the
day to pick up your badge, join a doc sprint, or meet some of your fellow attendees.

The Writing Day is modeled after the concept of ["sprints"][sprints] from
the open source and software development worlds. The idea is simple: to get a
bunch of interesting people in a room together and have them work towards shared
goals.

Sprint projects include
Mozilla's [MDN][mdn] and Write the Docs's [resources for
documentarians][wtd-resources]. [OpenNews][opennews] will also join us to
bring open source to journalism. You are welcome to bring your own project
to work on. Let us know and we will add it to the list on our website, 
so people will know it's an option.

New this year, the combined efforts of a couple of meetup organizers have produced an 
[API docs workshop][APIdocs] on Sunday as well.

We encourage everyone to drop by on Sunday evening for our conference reception.
You'll have a chance to get acquainted with each other over some drinks and
snacks. We'll also help groups organize dinner plans so that you can continue
your conversations over more substantial food.

Welcome Wagon. New this Year!
--------------------------------------------------

Making their debut at this year's conference, Christy and Leona of Jive Software are 
pleased to present their Welcome Wagon. Check out their [page of tips][wagon] to learn more about 
what to expect, and how to prepare for optimal conference enjoyment. You might also consider 
joining one of their pre-conference hall walk-throughs if you've never attended before, 
or if you just can't quite remember where everything is at the Crystal. 
Or just to meet some fellow attendees!

Monday and Tuesday - Conference
-------------------------------

We've released the breakdown of [our daily schedule][schedule], and will
release the full talk schedule soon. The doors
open at 8am on both days, so that you can arrive early, get yourself settled, grab some breakfast, 
and take advantage of the Welcome Wagon. The introduction begins at 9:00am. Talks
run all day, until shortly after 5pm. 

We'll hold an unconference downstairs in Lola's Room again this year, again on
both days. The unconference begins shortly after lunch,
and will continue until the end of the day. Sessions begin with a
couple of topics to get you started, followed by time for unstructured topics.
If you are interested in leading a session, [read more about our unconference][unconference] .
