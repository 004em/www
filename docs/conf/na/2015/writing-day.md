## Writing Day

Write the Docs this year will have a new Writing Day.
This is modeled after [Sprints](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_%28software_development%29) from the open source world.
The idea is to get a bunch of interesting people in a room together and have them work towards shared goals.

The Write the Docs Writing Day will follow this model.
We ask that everyone either come with a project,
or be ready and willing to contribute to someone elses project.
This project can be anything,
but some ideas:

* Open Source Software Documentation
* General Documentation Writing
* Best Practices Manual (For your Company, or the World)
* Blog Posts 
* Tips and Tricks 
* Great Works of Fiction 
* Love Letters
* The Documentarian Manifesto

You get the idea.

The main outcome is sitting in a room full of smart people sharing your problems, and your passion.
Come ready to learn some new things,
and to teach others what you know.
It may not [feel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) like you know that much,
but believe me,
you have a lot to share as well as learn.

#### Logisitics

Please bring a computer with you, or some other mechanism to create written words.
We'll be creating and editing content,

If you have your own to add to the list,
feel free to [email us](mailto:conf@writethedocs.org) or even better, [submit a pull request]().

##### [Write the Docs Website](http://www.writethedocs.org)

We have a website for our community, but it kinda sucks. Help us make it better by adding content, archiving old talks and notes, and just making it more friendly in general. Remember, you *are* the community.

##### [Write the Docs Guide](http://docs.writethedocs.org/)

Write about writing documentation. Help us make this guide great for people who want to write docs, but don't know where to start

##### [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)

Help document the internet. They always need more people to help contribute, edit, translate, and do more to help make the internet more approachable.

##### [Write the Docs Organizers Guide]()

Want to run your own Write the Docs meetup or conference? Help us make the materials for doing that available, beautiful, and on the internet.

##### Your Project Here

Yup. We know you need better docs, we do too. Make it happen.
