## Writing Day

This year, Write the Docs will have a new Writing Day, modeled after the concept of [sprints](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_%28software_development%29) from the open source world. The idea is simple: to get a bunch of interesting people in a room together and have them work towards shared goals.

To make the most out of the Writing Day, we recommend that you either come with a project, or be ready and willing to contribute to someone else's project.

Here are some examples of projects that you might want to work on:

* Open source software documentation
* General documentation writing
* Best practices manual (For your company, or the world)
* Blog posts 
* Tips and tricks 
* Great works of fiction 
* Love letters
* The Documentarian Manifesto

You get the idea.

All this adds up to a room full of smart people sharing your problems, your passion, and your goals.
So be ready to learn some new things and to teach others what you know.

It may not [feel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) like you know that much, but take it from us, you would surprise yourself with how much you can share.

#### Logisitics

Please bring a computer or some other mechanism with which to create written words.

We'll be creating and editing content, so make sure you are able to do so with the tools you bring with you.

-   Date & Time: **Sunday, May 17th, 9am-6pm**, with the conference opening reception in the same space until 9, so feel free to keep working longer!

#### Projects

Below are some suggested projects that you can work on during the Writing Day.
If you have your own to add to the list, feel free to [email us](mailto:conf@writethedocs.org) or even better, [submit a pull request]().

##### [Open News](http://opennews.org/blog/code-convening-wtd/)

The Open News team will have multiple journalism projects that are being documented and open sourced.
Help improve the docs on some amazing code that helps people understand the news everyday.

##### [Write the Docs Website](http://www.writethedocs.org)

We have a website for our community, but it kinda sucks. Help us make it better by adding content, archiving old talks and notes, or just making it more friendly in general. Remember, you *are* the community.

##### [Write the Docs Guide](http://docs.writethedocs.org/)

A guide about writing documentation. Help us make this guide great for people who want to write docs, but don't know where to start.

##### [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)

Help document the internet. Mozilla always needs more people to create, edit, and translate content, so we can do more to help make the internet more approachable.

##### Your Project Here

Yup. We know you need better docs. We do too. Make it happen.
