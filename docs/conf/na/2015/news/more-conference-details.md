Sunday - Writing Day and Preregistration Party
----------------------------------------------

During the day on Sunday, we will be holding our [Writing Day][writing-day]
, followed by our preregistration party in the evening.

Our base of operations for all of our events on Sunday is CENTRL Office, located
at 1355 NW Everett St ([map][centrl-map]).  Head there at any point during the
day to pick up your badge, work on some documentation at the sprints, or join us
in the evening to get to meet some of the fellow attendees.

The Writing Day is modeled after the concept of ["sprints"][sprints] from
the open source and software development worlds. The idea is simple: to get a
bunch of interesting people in a room together and have them work towards shared
goals.

There will be a number of projects being focused on at the sprints, including
Mozilla's [MDN][mdn], [Wordpress][wordpress], Write the Docs's [resources for
documentarians][wtd-resources], and [OpenNews][opennews] will be joining us to
bring open source to journalism. You are also welcome to bring your own project
to work on, or feel free to suggest your project for sprints and get others
involved.

We encourage everyone to drop by on Sunday evening for our preregistration
party. Attendees will have a chance to get acquainted with each other over some
drinks and snacks. We'll be helping groups to organize dinner plans so that you
can continue your conversations over some food as well.
