Thanks for coming to Write the Docs North America
=================================================

Hi everyone,

Thanks for attending our third North America Write the Docs conference in Portland! We're so grateful to our sponsors, speakers, volunteers, and attendees for making the conference possible. 

Here are some links to resources like videos, notes, forum, and an anonymous survey to tell us how we can improve.

## Videos

We're almost finished posting the videos. You can access the videos that are already posted here: <https://twitter.com/search?q=%23writethedocs%20from%3Anextdayvideo&src=typd>

## Notes

We have a GitHub repository with notes about the talks and unconference sessions, sourced from all the folks at the conference. If you have notes, feel free to contribute them or read existing notes here: <https://github.com/writethedocs/attendee-notes>

## Meetups

We hope you continue to build the community and keep in touch with other documentarians in your hometown. In this spirit, we have a number of meetups in cities across the country. If you don't see your city listed, consider starting a meetup! 

Keep us posted if you start one (or encounter a new one) so that we can spread the word.
