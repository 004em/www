Thanks for coming to Write the Docs
===================================

Hi everyone,

Thanks for attending our third Portland Write the Docs conference! We're so grateful to our sponsors, speakers, volunteers, and attendees for making the conference possible. 

We've included links to resources like videos, notes, forum, and an anonymous survey to tell us what we can improve.

## Videos

We're almost finished posting the videos. We weren't able to film Lola's Room talks, but we're just about done getting the videos up from the main stage. You can access the videos here: TODO

## Notes

We have a GitHub repository that is sourced from all the folks at the conference. If you have notes, feel free to contribute them, or read others: <https://github.com/writethedocs/attendee-notes>

## Meetups

We hope you continue to build community and keep in touch with people that are local to you. In this spirit, we have a number of meetups in cities across the country. If you don't see your city listed, consider starting a meetup. Keep us posted if you start one (or encounter a new one) so we can spread the word.

## Connect with other documentarians

We have a forum here: <http://forum.writethedocs.org/>

We think this is the easiest way to share information with the WTD community. Join the forum, and feel free to start a topic or chime in on an existing thread.

## Tell us how we did

Let us know what we can improve for future conferences and gatherings. We really appreciate your candid feedback.

That's all for now. Once again, thanks a million for coming, and for making the conference possible.
