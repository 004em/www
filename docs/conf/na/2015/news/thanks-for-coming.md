Thanks for coming to Write the Docs North America
=================================================

Hi everyone,

Thanks for attending our third North America Write the Docs conference in Portland! We're so grateful to our sponsors, speakers, volunteers, and attendees for making the conference possible. 

Here are some links to resources like videos, notes, forum, and an anonymous survey to tell us how we can improve.

## Speak or Sponsor in Europe

Don't forget we have our European conference this year in Prague! The CFP is still open, and has been extended until June 15 to allow for those of you who were inspired by our NA conference to submit proposals for the EU conference. We're also looking for more sponsors to make the event just as magical as NA.

You can find information about the conference and CFP on our [European Conference website](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2015/).

If you are curious about sponsoring EU or NA again next year,
please contact us at <sponsorships@writethedocs.org>.

## Videos

We're almost finished posting the videos. You can access the videos that are already posted via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23writethedocs%20from%3Anextdayvideo&src=typd)

## Notes

We have a GitHub repository with notes about the talks and unconference sessions, sourced from all the folks at the conference. If you have notes, feel free to contribute them or read [existing notes](https://github.com/writethedocs/attendee-notes).

## Meetups

We hope you continue to build the community and keep in touch with other documentarians in your hometown. In this spirit, we have a number of meetups in cities across the country. If you don't see your city listed, consider starting a meetup! 

Keep us posted if you start one (or encounter a new one) so that we can spread the word.

We hope that this forum will serve as the easiest way to share information with the community. Join the forum, and feel free to start a topic or chime in on an existing thread.

Let us know how we can improve for future conferences and gatherings. We really appreciate your candid feedback!

The conference is only possible because folks like you make it happen.
Thanks for making it another wonderful year.
We hope to see you back again next year,
or even sooner at one of our other meetups that happen throughout the year.
