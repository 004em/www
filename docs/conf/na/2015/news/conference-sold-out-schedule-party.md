Conference sells out, Schedule Details, and Party Venue
=======================================================

Exciting times in Write the Docs world!
We've officially sold out the conference at 350 documentarians,
who will be converging on Portland for a few delightful days of documentation.
We just sent off the order for badges,
and everything is getting quite real.

Full Schedule
--------------

We have announced the final [schedule](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2015/schedule/) for the conference. 
This includes all of the various activities around the event,
including the hike, writing day, reception, party, and the actual conference talks!
We have packed a lot into a few days,
so I hope you're ready!

Party Venue
-----------

The party will be held at TILT,
where we have rented out a full side of the restaraunt.
It will be from 7pm-11pm on Monday evening,
so make sure to come!

TILT is located at 1355 NW Everett St,
in the same block as CENTRL Office where we will be the day before.
Here's a [map](https://goo.gl/maps/ZoKCP) with directions from the venue.
It's only a few minute walk.

We'll have lots of free food and free drinks,
and it is a great chance to get to know the other attendees better.
Please keep it responsible though,
we have another day of exciting talks on Tuesday :)

The conference is next week, and I hope you're getting ready!
