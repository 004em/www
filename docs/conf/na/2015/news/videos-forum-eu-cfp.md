# Check out the Videos, Forum, and European Call for Proposals

Write the Docs NA 2015 was another fabulous event.
We brought over 350 documentarians to Portland to learn from each other,
and help build community.

We have a couple updates and reminders for you to keep in touch with the Write the Docs community all year round.

## Write the Docs Forum

Our [Forum](http://forum.writethedocs.org/) is the best place to keep in touch with other documentarians all year round. 

The forum is great for: 

* Answering questions about writing
* Looking for a job
* Finding a local meetup
* Just keeping in touch

We already have **100 documentarians** on the [forum](http://forum.writethedocs.org/), so join today and keep the good vibes going all year.

## Videos

We have [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmV2D6sIiX3UW1kPWlhzyo4lr6e3US6re) from every talk from our conference this year. If you missed something, you can always catch it on video.

Don't forget, we've recorded [every talk](http://www.writethedocs.org/videos/) at Write the Docs, from every year.
Check out some of the previous years talks as well,
they are fantastic.

## European Call for Proposals and Ticket Sales

If you loved our North American event,
don't forget we have a [European conference](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2015/) as well.
Join us in Prague at the end of August.

The [Call for Proposals](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2015/cfp/) ends tomorrow, and early bird tickets are already sold out. 
We expect this event to sell out also,
so don't wait to buy tickets.

## 2016

We're starting the planning process for 2016 already.
We are planning to be back in Portland in May,
and will have firm dates in the next couple months.
