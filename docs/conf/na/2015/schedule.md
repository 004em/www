# Schedule

Write the Docs is more than a conference.  Each year we organize a wide bunch
of events so that people can join together, collaborate, and learn from each
other.

## Saturday, May 16th

The only event scheduled on Saturday is the [annual hike to Pittock Mansion][hike].
If you get into town early, join us on the hike and take the chance to explore
Portland in all of its glory.

## Sunday, May 17th

During the day, we will be holding our [Writing Day documentation sprints][writing-day],
followed by our conference reception in the evening.

Our base of operations for all of our events on Sunday is Centrl Office, located
at 1355 NW Everett St.  Head there at any point during the day to pick up your
badge, work on some documentation at the sprints, or join us in the evening to
get to know some of the fellow attendees.

We encourage everyone to drop by on Sunday evening for our conference
reception. Attendees will have a chance to get acquainted with each other over some
drinks and snacks. We'll be helping groups to organize dinner plans so that you
can continue your conversations over some food as well.
