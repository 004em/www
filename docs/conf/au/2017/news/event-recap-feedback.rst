Write the Docs Day Australia 2017 - Recap
=================================================

A big thank you to all attending the 2017 and our first Australian Write the
Docs Day in Melbourne. We are extremely grateful to our sponsors, volunteers,
speakers and attendees. We loved the time, effort and passion put in by
everyone for this event.

Hopefully, this event met people’s expectations and provided an opportunity to
learn, meet and  interact with other documentarians from a growing community.

Here is a quick recap of the event, along with the feedback received from
attendees and speakers. Links to photos and videos will be made available soon.
We encourage you to keep in touch and continue support and build this
community.

Summary of events
------------------

9.00 am - 1.00 pm Writing (Half) Day
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first half of the day was dedicated to a documentation sprint, with
attendees contributing to one of the 5 open source projects that were pitched
on the day. Attendees could choose from Dart, Kubernetes, ReactiveUI, Webpact
or Cyrus mail.
Sarah Maddox had blogged about the Doc sprint experience here:

2.00 pm - 4.30 pm Presentations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The afternoon schedule consisted of 5 awesome presentations from local,
interstate and international speakers.

Margaret Fero gave us a very succinct talk on things to consider while
creating and delivering documentation for a variety of use cases.

Chris Ward spoke about the increasing popularity of bots and what this
could mean for writers, especially working with conversational interfaces.

Laura Bailey demonstrated the process she adopts before writing anything, be it
technical documentation or presentations.

Nicola Nye’s technical talk focused around Sphinx to generate docs across
multiple formats.

Lastly, Brice Fallon spoke about how documentarians can practice minimalism
in their content.

*Note*: All the videos for these talks will be available on the Write the Docs
Australia Youtube channel shortly.

Social event (6pm onwards)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Social event was pay-your-own drinks and dinner at a popular cafe along
South Wharf alongside Melbourne CBD.

Feedback
--------

During the event, we received a number of comments on the organisation of the
event, including the quality of presentations, networking opportunities and
affordable cost of attending the event. The inclusion of tea/coffee and swag
(t-shirts and stickers) was appreciated.
The choice of venue and selecting a professional videographer to record
presentations were some other things people appreciated.

After the event, we emailed the attendees and asked for specific feedback on
the event.

A few suggestions, in no particular order:

* Schedule the doc sprint after the presentations.
* Include more presentations if possible.
* Increase the duration of the doc sprint so that the attendees can get more time
   to familiarise themselves with the project/product.
* Pitch the documentation sprint projects in advance (before the actual
   documentation sprint) to allow attendees to prepare
* Organise the social event closer to the conference venue.

We appreciate all your feedback, and strive to take this on board and evolve
our events to make everyone’s experience a happier one.

Retrospective
-------------

As an organiser, some of the feedback aligned with my own expectations.
This are some of the things I made a note of:

What worked
~~~~~~~~~~~

The venue - It was not centrally located, but wasn’t that difficult to get to
either. The meeting hall was adequate for our attendee numbers.
Tea/coffee arrangements - The walk to the nearest coffee shop was an
interesting concept as it allowed to break the pace and opportunities to
chat with other attendees.

Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Event website: A few people commented that the website content wasn’t
clear and needed more information.
there was some confusion on usage of terms around lunch and dinner arrangements.

Write the Docs Australia

-----

The `Write the Docs Slack <http://writethedocs.org/slack/>`_ has really grown this last year. 
Our Slack channels have been extra busy in the days and weeks leading up to the conference,
and we hope that y’all continue the conversations throughout the year.
If you haven’t joined, head on over and join us.

It’s early days and we are working on a bigger and better version of Write
the Docs Australia conference for 2018. Date, venue and call for proposals
will be released early next year.

In the meantime, save the dates for our US and EU next year:

* Portland conference, 6-8 May 2018
