Instead of having a lunch at the venue, we will head to the closest cafe/s, pub or half a dozen places (including a few that cater to various dietary requirements).
Melbourne has a great coffee culture and there are at least 2-3 really good cafe's within a 10 min walk that can cater to your caffeine needs.

Accessible restrooms are on the ground floor near the meeting room.
The venue does not have gender-neutral or family restrooms available. Use the restroom for the gender with which you identify.
